4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,720
无功受禄

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,290
办公设施方面真的不能削减开支了?
We can't economise in accommodation?

6
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,576
恐怕不能 大臣
'Fraid not, Minister.

7
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,892
信息处理设备方面呢?      不可能 到底了
Data-processing equipment? Not possible.

8
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,451
成人教育预算?      很不幸 没法削减
The further education budget? Sadly, it can't be.

9
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,210
好吧 至少本科教育开支有所减少
At least the universities won't cost us as much,

10
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,259
外国学生学费抵了教育开支
with overseas students paying fees covering education costs.

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,175
除非您批准例外提案...      不 很抱歉 绝无例外
Unless you make exceptions...? No, sorry, no exceptions.

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,251
至少这方面还能省
At least, that's one saving.

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,095
大臣 已经…      哦 当然
Minister, it's... Yes, of course.

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,854
恐怕就到这里了 散会
That's all, I'm afraid. Meeting over.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,658
多谢      谢谢
Thank you Thank you.

16
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,451
大臣 在汉弗莱爵士来之前
Before Sir Humphrey comes,

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,330
首相府授勋秘书要您批准部门授勋名单
Number 10 asked you to approve recommendations for the honours list.

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,934
伯纳 你问了八遍了
That's the eighth time you've asked.

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,331
难道授勋就是部里的头等大事吗?
Are honours the most serious concern of this department?

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,210
是的 榜上有名的人整天守着电话 有的三天没合眼了
They are to the people on the list. Some haven't slept fordays.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,612
急什么急? 大臣几时否决过文官受勋?
What are they worried about? Ministers never veto honours.

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,375
几乎没有 但理论上有可能 越拖他们越心慌
It's possible. They're worried about the delay.

23
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,533
他们怎么知道的? 文件上写着"绝密"
How do people know they're listed? Its marked "Strictly Confidential"

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,452
哦 大臣
Oh, Minister...

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,858
是我犯傻
Silly of me.

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,979
真希望他们能花四分之一的精力削减开支
If they'd put some of that effort into cutting expenditure...

27
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,257
怎么才能让人们对节约
How can I make people want economies

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,015
像对帝国勋章 大巴思勋章一样热心呢?
in the same way they want OBEs and KCBs?

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,695
我觉得... 不 不 不...
I've been thinking... No, no, no.

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,499
什么?      不 不 没事
What? No, no, nothing...

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,619
来吧 伯纳 说出来
Spit it out.

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,736
我没资格...我不提倡 也不支持 但是
It's not my place, and I couldn't possibly recommend it...

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,018
如果您不批准公务员授勋
Suppose you were to refuse to recommend any honours

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,174
除非他们削减预算5%如何?
for civil servants who hadn't cut their budgets by 5 %?

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,178
伯纳      对不起 大臣 我…
Bernard! Sorry, Minister...

36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,457
不 伯纳 这太妙了
No, Bernard! It's brilliant!

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,376
好主意 公务员就这一个死穴 对吗?
It's the answer. It's the only hold we have over the civil servants.

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,010
我管不了他们加薪 或者晋升
I can't stop their pay rises or their promotions.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,696
不写他们的工作报告 但我可以不给他们授勋
I don't even write their reports, but I can with hold their honours!

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,136
干得好 伯纳      是您自己想到的 大臣
Well done. You thought of it, Minister.

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,532
不 不 是你想出来的      不 是您想出来的
No, no, you thought of it. No, you thought of it.

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,569
求您
Please!

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,339
请少加点 谢谢
Just a touch, please. Thank you very much.

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,413
真是丰盛的晚餐 院长 我一向乐意叨扰府上
Splendid dinner. I always enjoy my visits here.

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,811
今后怕是来不了喽 汉弗莱
I'm afraid this could be your last.

46
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,768
怎么?我把酒传错方向了吗?
Why? Did I pass the port the wrong way?

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,774
告诉他吧 财务处长      贝利学院快破产了
Tell him, Bursar. The college's going to the wall.

48
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,378
多亏你们部的新政 对外国学生收全额学费
It's your new policy of charging overseas students full rates.

49
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,849
牛津大多数学院还能应付
Other Oxford colleges can cope,

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,775
但是贝利的外国学生向来是最多的
but we've always had many overseas students here at Baillie.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,489
对 可是全额就全额 有什么关系
You simply charge them a full fee, no problem.

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,573
可他们付不起 四千磅一年? 没人肯来
Unless they can't pay ?,000 a year. They won't come.

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,054
我跑遍世界 甚至到美国筹款 兜售牛津教育理念
I've been all over the USA selling them the idea of an Oxford education

54
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,132
非洲满是英国教授
Africa is crawling with British professors

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,930
拼命要把社会学课程塞给当地人
frantically trying to flog sociology courses to the natives.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,332
在印度和中东 也是你死我活
And India and the Middle East. Competition is cut-throat.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,095
何不改招英国本国学生?
Why not fill up vacancies with British undergraduates?

58
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,131
一点都不好笑 汉弗莱
I don't think that's awfully funny, Humphrey.

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,288
我没说笑话      老伙计 怎么能招本国学生
I wasn't trying to be funny. Anything but home students!

60
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,818
为什么?      一名英国学生只能收500磅
Why? We only get 500 a head forthem.

61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,735
400人才抵得上50个外国学生
We'd have to take 400 to replace a mere 50 foreigners.

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,371
师生比例会从1:10变成1:34
The staff/student ratio would go from 1:10 to 1:34.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,819
教室和寝室会挤得像沃伍德监狱
We'd have classrooms, dormitories... like Wormwood Scrubs!

64
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,373
或者像苏塞克斯大学
Or the University of Sussex!

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,499
院长估计这些画能卖两三万磅
The Master thinks the pictures mayfetch ?030,000.

66
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,969
画加上银器
The pictures and silver together

67
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,530
刚够新教学楼的贷款利息
might just pay the mortgage interest.

68
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,294
天啊 天啊
Dear, oh, dear!

69
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,976
当然 也可以让政府对我们网开一面
Orwe could get the Government to treat us as an exception.

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,813
有趣的是 汉弗莱
Interestingly, Humphrey,

71
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,134
这个权利似乎在你的大臣手上
it seems to be your Minister who has the authority.

72
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,533
怎样才能说服大臣认同贝利学院的重要性呢?
Howmight one persuade aMinister of the importance of Baillie College?

73
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,818
我不知道 不如请他来出席贵宾晚宴?
Why not get him down to a High Table dinner?

74
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,929
以他的智商能理解我们的状况吗?
Is he of the intellectual calibre to understand our case?

75
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,050
可以吧
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,771
这么简单的状况
It's intelligible to anyone

77
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,057
连维尼熊都能理解
with the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh!

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,017
就是
Quite!

79
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,174
哈克的智商能比上维尼熊?
And Hacker is of the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh?

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,417
哦 可以的
Oh, yes!

81
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,331
状态好的话
On his day.

82
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,889
早安 大臣      早安 汉弗莱
Morning, Minister. Morning, Humphrey.

83
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,857
有两件事 大臣
Two things, Minister.

84
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,458
首先 部里推荐的授勋名单
Firstly, the departmental recommendations for the honours list.

85
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,817
又是授勋名单      是的 大臣
The honours list again! Yes, Minister.

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,576
先放一放好吧?      不能放 大臣
Let's leave that for the moment. We can't leave it, Minister.

87
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,050
快到5星期期限了      5星期?
It's getting nearthe five weeks. Five weeks?

88
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,178
对 凡授勋都要提前5星期通知
All recipients are notified five weeks before.

89
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,410
好让他们有时间拒绝
It gives them time to refuse.

90
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,175
几时有公务员拒绝过授勋?
When did a civil servant last refuse an honour?

91
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,093
应该是财政部那位 拒绝骑士头衔
Somebody in the Treasury refused a knigh thood.

92
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,696
天啊 哪年?      似乎是1496年
When? I think itwas 1496.

93
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,457
为什么?      他有一个了
Why? He'd already got one.

94
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,851
大臣 如果您已经批准...      汉弗莱
Lf you've approved the list... Humphrey...

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,330
你知不知道20%勋位都授给了公务员?
Did you know that 20 % of honours go to civil servants?

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,298
这是对他们勤奋工作的适当奖赏 大臣
Afitting tribute to their devotion to duty.

97
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,530
不 他们已经拿薪水了
That's what they get paid for.

98
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,579
我们这些人得有特殊贡献才能得荣誉
The rest of us have to do something special to get an honour.

99
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,609
为弱智儿童工作20年才换一枚帝国勋章
They work for years with the mentally handicapped to get an MBE.

100
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,011
而你们的骑士头衔水到渠成
Your knigh thoods simply come up with the rations.

101
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,014
大臣 女皇陛下的公务员们一辈子
Minister, her Majesty's civil servants spend their lives

102
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,651
领取微薄薪水 最终默默无闻地退休
working for a modest wage and at the end retire in to obscurity.

103
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,739
荣誉只能稍微告慰他们为国家
Honours are a small reward for a lifetime of loyal,

104
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,133
和女王忠贞不渝 鞠躬尽瘁的一生
self-effacing discretion and devoted service to the nation.

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,655
微薄薪水?      唉 是的
"A modest wage"? Alas, yes.

106
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,130
汉弗莱 你一年的薪水超过三万镑
You get over?0,000 a year!

107
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,976
比我还多七千英镑      对 可是相比之下仍算微薄
That's ?,000 more than I get. But still relatively modest.

108
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,213
跟谁比?
Relative to whom?

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,575
像伊丽莎白·泰勒
Elizabeth Taylor, for example.

110
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,940
汉弗莱 你和伊丽莎白·泰勒毫无可比性
You are not relative to Elizabeth Taylor.

111
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,690
你们俩截然不同
There are important differences.

112
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,337
可不是 她又没在牛津拿过第一
Indeed, yes. She didn't get a first at Oxford.

113
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,056
你也不会默默无闻退休
And retire into obscurity?

114
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,340
你拿大笔养老金 去石油公司和银行做董事
You take a massive pension and become directors of oil companies.

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,536
那也是默默无闻的董事
But very obscure directors.

116
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,012
还没有炒鱿鱼之忧 干工业的 犯错误你会被解雇
You're in no dangerof the sack. In industry, you get the boot.

117
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,217
做公务员 你犯错误 我被解雇
In the civil service, if you screw up, I get the boot!

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,175
很好笑 大臣 那份名单...      不行 汉弗莱
Very droll, Minister. The list... No, Humphrey.

119
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,697
我不会白批 公务员得自己挣来荣誉
I'll not approve any honour to any civil servant who hasn't earned it.

120
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,896
您说什么"挣来"?      挣来就是挣来
What do you mean, "earned it"? I mean "earned it".

121
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,338
无功不受禄      这种事闻所未闻
Done something to deserve it. But that's unheard of!

122
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,448
我的新政要求部里所有公务员每年
My new policy is to withhold all honours from civil servants

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,533
削减预算5% 否则不给授勋
who do not make a cut in their budgets of 5 % per year.

124
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,409
你是不是默许啦?
Your silence indicates approval?

125
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,539
绝不是 您哪来这么荒谬的想法?
It does not! Where did you get that preposterous idea?

126
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,693
是...
It...

127
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,974
我突然想到的      荒唐透顶 闻所未闻 不可能
...just came to me. It's ridiculous! Unheard of!

128
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,700
怎么?      这整个想法就...
The whole idea is... It's...

129
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,897
它从根本上危及...
It strikes at the very roots of...

130
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,654
它是灭亡的前兆
It's the beginning of the end!

131
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,937
是导火索 是左翼激进主义
The thin end of the wedge! A Bennite solution!

132
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,814
然后呢? 您要废除君主制吗?
What next? Abolition of the monarchy?

133
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,618
别发傻 汉弗莱
Don't be absurd.

134
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,056
这个体系一直完美运转 无需改变
The system has worked so well in the past.

135
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,539
它不完美
It hasn't.

136
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,932
我们得公平审视这一体制      就知道你会说
Give it a fairtrial. I thought you might say that...

137
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,858
告诉你 嘉德勋章由爱德华三世设立于1348年
The Most Noble Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 by Edward III.

138
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,932
审判期该结束了吧?
It's at the end of its trial period now.

139
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,855
大臣 一旦您借经济阻碍荣誉
Minister, if you block honours pending economies,

140
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,978
您可能开创一个危险的先例
you might create a dangerous precedent.

141
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,651
你是说这次我们做对了
If we do the right thing now,

142
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,812
下次也非对不可?
we'll have to do the right thing next time?

143
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,211
天哪汉弗莱 什么都别干才是正理么      恰恰相反
Nothing would get done at all! On the contrary.

144
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,578
有很多事应该做 可是      不要做第一个
Many things must be done, but... Nothing done for the first time.

145
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,059
不 大臣
No, Minister!

146
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,011
我完全支持您的意图 我会全力予以贯彻
I'm fully seized of your aims, and I'll try to put them into practice.

147
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,499
为此目的
To that end,

148
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,812
我提议设立各部联席委员会广泛调查
I recommend we set up a committee with broad terms of reference,

149
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,814
以便最终考虑到一切后果
so we're in a position to think through the various implications

150
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,131
并从长远考虑角度出发作出决定
and decide based on long-term considerations

151
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,771
而不是仓促采取轻率 考虑欠周的行动
rather than rush prematurely into precipitate and ill-conceived actions

152
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,330
从而造成无法预料的后果
which might have unforeseen repercussions.

153
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,899
你是说"不行"?
You mean "no"?

154
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,895
我是说 就目前看来 等时机成熟…
I mean, as faras one can see, in the fullness of time...

155
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,733
不 不 不 汉弗莱
No, no, no, Humphrey.

156
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,050
你了解我 雷厉风行
You know me: Action now!

157
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,892
雷厉风行
Action now.

158
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,972
神志健全的人都不想被授勋
Nobody in their right mind can want honours.

159
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,257
授勋引起奉承 势利 嫉妒
They encourage sycophancy, snobbery, jealousy,

160
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,218
这些都归公务员可不公平
and civil servants shouldn't get them all!

161
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,057
可是大臣...      不 汉弗莱 抱歉 我主意已定
But Minister... No, no! I'm sorry. I have decided.

162
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,053
还有一件呢?      还有一件?
Your other point? Other point?

163
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,053
你说有两件事的      是吗?
You had two. Did I?

164
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,815
是的 抱歉 气糊涂了
Yes, I'm sorry. The shock!

165
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,177
大臣 昨天我会见了牛津贝利学院的代表
Yesterday, I had representations from Baillie College, Oxford.

166
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,812
照外国学生学费的新规定 他们一年损失二十五万
Grants for overseas students... They'll lose millions a year.

167
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,778
多招英国学生不就完了
They must just take more British students.

168
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,054
他们当然极其乐意 大臣 但是
Nothing would please them more, but you see...

169
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,098
贝利学院的外国学生最多
Baillie has many foreign students,

170
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,330
新政会严重打击
and there could be repercussions

171
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,970
热带病学系和国际公法系
at the schools of tropical medicine, international law,

172
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,257
阿拉伯语系甚至得停办
and the Arabic department may have to close down.

173
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,015
对不起 我不能花纳税人的钱去教育外国人
We can't educate foreigners at the taxpayer's expense.

174
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,932
不单单是外国人 大臣
Not just foreigners.

175
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,538
如果外交部没地方给新人员培训阿拉伯文化
If the diplomatic service had nowhere to immerse its recruits,

176
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,535
后果不堪设想 甚至会有亲以色列的外交部
the results could be catastrophic, with a pro-Israeli Foreign Office!

177
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,860
石油政策会变成什么样?
What would happen to our oil policy?

178
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,739
那么只能换个地方培训
Its recruits must go elsewhere.

179
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,334
还有哪能学习阿拉伯语?
Where else would they learn Arabic?

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,536
阿拉伯?
Arabia?

181
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,373
事实上 大臣 贝利学院确有过人之处
Baillie College has an outstanding record.

182
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,089
多年来 它使英国监狱人满为患      监狱?
It's filled our jails for years. Jails?

183
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,094
是的 您看 字母JB代表英联邦最高荣誉
Yes. The letters "JB" are the finest honour in the Commonwealth.

184
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,855
"JB"?      "英国犯人"
"JB"? "Jailed by the British".

185
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,932
甘地(印度) 恩克鲁玛(加纳) 马卡李奥(塞浦路斯)
Gandhi, Nkrumah, Makarios,

186
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
本-古理安(以色列) 肯雅塔(肯尼亚)
Ben-Gurion, Kenyatta,

187
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,260
尼赫鲁(印度) 穆加贝(津巴布韦)
Nehru, Mugabe.

188
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,334
各国领导人 无穷无尽 很有几名我们的校友
The list of leaders is endless and contains several of ourstudents.

189
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,456
"我们的校友"?
"Ourstudents"?

190
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,532
汉弗莱 你上的哪所学院?
Humphrey... which college did you go to?

191
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,209
大臣 这完全是题外话
That is quite beside the point.

192
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,575
我就喜欢聊题外话
I like being beside the point.

193
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,055
说来听听 汉弗莱 你上的哪所学院?
Humourme, Humphrey. Which college did you go to?

194
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,292
该不会刚好是贝利学院吧?
Was it Baillie, by any strange coincidence?

195
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,297
恰巧...我也是贝利人
It so happens... I am a Baillie man,

196
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,655
但这完全是两码事
but that has nothing to do with it!

197
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,651
对对对 两码事嘛
No, of course not.

198
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,050
想什么呢 不害臊
Perish the thought. Naughty.

199
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,215
喂? 下院分组表决 大臣
Yes? The division, Minister.

200
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,690
就这么定了吧 汉弗莱 没时间了
That rathersettles it. No more time.

201
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,328
伯纳 我该投赞成还是反对?
Am I voting "aye" or"no"?

202
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,776
投反对 反对党的修正案 第二读...     管它是什么
"No". It's a... I don't want to know what it is.

203
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,818
我只怕走错门而已
I don't want to go through the wrong door.

204
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,295
阿诺德?
Arnold?

205
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,254
汉弗莱 请坐
Humphrey! Do sit down.

206
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,458
希望你不介意来一趟内阁办公室
Hope you don't mind my dragging you here.

207
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,250
哦 没关系      我有点担心你的大臣
No, please. I was worried about your Minister.

208
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,733
"将勋章跟节约挂钩"
Linking honours to economies.

209
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,414
哦 您听说了? 纯粹胡说八道
That? A lot of nonsense.

210
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,048
很好 你是说没那回事
Good. You mean it's not true?

211
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,213
不完全...他确实是提到了
Not exactly. That is, he did just mention it.

212
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,694
但是...      但是什么?
But... But what?

213
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,335
我找不到有效论据来反驳他
I can't find any effective arguments against it.

214
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,053
汉弗莱 这可是导火索      我说了
It's the thin end of the wedge. That's what I said.

215
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,336
是左翼激进主义      我也说了
A Bennite solution. I said that.

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,333
后果不堪设想      我都说了
Where will it end? That's what I said.

217
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,969
确实无法容忍 但是...
No, it's intolerable, but...

218
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,212
又不可违抗
irresistible.

219
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,658
是啊 我不是指摘你 我也不了解内情
I'm not reprimanding you, I don't know the facts well enough.

220
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,211
但作为秘书长 我希望你保证他不会实施
I'd like your assurance that he won't be putting it into practice.

221
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,450
我当然希望不会
I certainly hope he won't.

222
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,737
"希望"恐怕不够
I'm not sure that hopes are good enough.

223
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,655
试想一旦你们部门实施 很快就会在政府扩散
Lfhe applied it to your department, the contagion would spread!

224
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,538
每一个部门
Every department!

225
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,219
那么 我们可以指望你咯?      我会尽力
Presumably, we can count on you? I shall certainly try.

226
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,770
但这...很棘手      你当然有你的办法
But... it's rathertricky. You know what you're doing.

227
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,535
但这可能让大家怀疑你是否可靠
This could cause people to reflect on your soundness.

228
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,858
当然我本人毫不怀疑 但是...
I've no doubts about you myself, but...

229
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,536
谈个心总是好的      当然 谢谢 阿诺德
I thought a chatwould be useful. Absolutely. Thank you.

230
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,898
对了 我刚刚跟我们学院的院长通了电话
By the way, I had our college master on the phone.

231
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,052
他说你上周在贝利参加了晚宴      是啊
He said you dined at Baillie. Right!

232
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,330
我保证你的大臣会给他们特殊待遇 对吧?
I assured them your Minister would treat them as a special case.

233
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,051
当然 当然
Yes... Yes...

234
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,939
我已经安排大臣参加贵宾宴会
I've got the Minister coming to a benefactors' dinner.

235
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,455
很好 你果然可靠
Good. Sound man.

236
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,375
好了 我得去10号了 感谢你过来 汉弗莱
I must be getting over to Number 10. Thanks for dropping in.

237
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,859
不胜荣幸
Pleasure...

238
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,611
阿诺德
Arnold.

239
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,089
据说汉弗莱爵士昨天
Sir Humphrey saw the Cabinet Secretary

240
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,535
被内阁秘书狠批一番      真的?
and got the most frightful wigging.

241
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,615
对 骂得他狗血淋头 为您的"按节约授勋"妙计
Really tore him off a strip because of your economie-honour scheme

242
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,058
是你的妙计 伯纳      我们商量好的
Your scheme. We've been through all that.

243
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,609
对 抱歉 我的妙计
Sorry. My scheme.

244
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,253
汉弗莱这种高级官员也会挨训吗?
Why wig someone as high up as Humphrey?

245
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,095
通常是很客气的 但这次显然已经无所顾忌了
Normally, it's civilised, but this time itwas no-holds-barred.

246
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,809
阿诺德爵士说不是故意要指摘他
SirArnold said he wasn't actually reprimanding him.

247
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,255
这么惨?      是啊
Bad as that, was it? Yes.

248
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,728
还暗示有人怀疑他的可靠程度
He suggested some people might not think he was sound.

249
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,335
大打出手啊      确实
A real punch-up! Indeed.

250
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,937
阿诺德爵士担心什么?他能拿的都拿了吧?
What has Sir Arnold to fear? He has all the honours he could want.

251
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,534
他才到G      G?
He has his "G". "G"?

252
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,534
先拿K 然后拿G      别打谜语 伯纳
You get your "G" after your "K". You speak in riddles.

253
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,932
先拿CMG 然后拿KCMG 最后拿GCMG
First you get the CMG, then the KCMG and the GCMG,

254
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,615
三等勋爵士 二等勋爵士
the Command of the Order of St Michael and St George,

255
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,055
大十字勋爵士
Knight Grand Cross of St George.

256
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,657
在部门里 CMG代表"叫我上帝"
In the service, CMG stands for "Call Me God".

257
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,608
而KCMG代表"请叫我上帝"
And KCMG for "Kindly Call Me God".

258
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,698
GCMG怎么讲?
And GCMG?

259
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,418
"上帝叫我上帝"
"God Calls Me God".

260
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,933
阿诺德爵士担心什么?他不是都拿遍了吗?
Why should SirArnold worry? He has his full quota of honours.

261
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,419
没有 差得远呢
Nowhere near!

262
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,570
还有贵族爵位 功绩勋章 荣誉三等男爵士勋章
There's a peerage, the CH

263
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,970
嘉德勋章 蓟花骑士勋章...
the OM, the Knight of the Thistle...

264
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,415
蓟花骑士? 发给谁的?
Knight of the Thistle? Who for?

265
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,017
苏格兰人和驴子?      二者有区别的 大臣
Scotsmen and donkeys? There's a distinction.

266
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,297
你是没碰到苏格兰民族主义分子
You haven't met the Scottish Nationalists!

267
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,774
谁管蓟花?      有个委员会就吃它了
How do they award the Thistle? A committee sits on it.

268
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,616
汉弗莱真以为我会改变大学财务政策
Does Humphrey think I'll change university policy

269
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,691
就为一个贵宾宴会?
over High Table dinner?

270
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,853
我听说贝利的宴会极为丰盛 大臣
I believe Baillie College give a very good dinner, Minister.

271
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,295
还有多远?      几分钟 40号高速很好走
How much further? A few minutes. The M40's good.

272
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,774
4号高速也不错
So's the M4...

273
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,489
为什么有两条这么好的路直通牛津
Why did we get two really good roads to Oxford

274
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,496
却没有一条通南安普敦或多佛 或者别的港口?
before any to Southampton or Dover or any of the ports?

275
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,699
几乎全体常任秘书都出身牛津 大臣
Nearly all our Permanent Secretaries went to Oxford, Minister,

276
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,899
牛津各学院都有很好的晚宴
and most Oxford colleges give very good dinners.

277
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,658
内阁纵容他们?      当然不 他们坚决反对
The Cabinet allow that? Certainly not.

278
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,210
他们禁止修路让文官们去牛津赴宴
They said no motorway to take civil servants to Oxford,

279
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,929
除非先修路让大臣们去乡下打猎
unless there was one to take Ministers hunting in the shires.

280
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,456
所以50年代的1号公路通往莱斯特乡间
That's why the M1 stopped in Leicestershire!

281
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,018
哦 少来了
Oh, come!

282
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,656
那刚完工的11号高速呢?
What about the M11 just completed?

283
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,334
剑桥各学院就不大宴宾客吗?
Doesn't Cambridge give as good dinners?

284
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,060
当然有 大臣 不过交通部
Yes, of course, but it's been years

285
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,099
多年没有剑桥出身的常任秘书了
since Transport had a Permanent Secretary from Cambridge.

286
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,413
作为快破产的的学院来说 晚宴不错嘛
Fora college on the edge ofbankruptcy, not a bad dinner!

287
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,936
菲兹沃晚宴由一笔特定基金支付
The Fitzwalter Dinner is paid forby endowment,

288
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,898
来自16世纪一位慷慨的赞助人
a great 16th-century benefactor.

289
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,088
平常我们只吃方便面拌腐乳
Most nights we eat Mother's Pride and processed cheese.

290
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,616
你们得找个20世纪的赞助人
You need a 20th-century benefactor.

291
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,012
您正好说到点子上      怎么了?
Interesting you should say that. Why?

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,740
赞助人数量稀少 相隔久远
Benefactors are few and farbetween.

293
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,576
艾萨克·沃尔森只是有史以来第二个被牛津
Isaac Wolfson is the second man to have a college named after him

294
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,300
和剑桥拿来命名学院的人      谁是第一个?
at Oxford and Cambridge. Who's the first?

295
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,779
耶稣
Jesus.

296
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,775
耶稣?      耶稣...基督
Jesus? Jesus... Christ.

297
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,739
我们最尊崇的那些赞助人
Some of ourmost revered benefactors are men

298
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,176
都曾拯救学院免遭政府掠夺
who saved the college from the depredations of Government.

299
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,094
他们的名字被顶礼膜拜几个世纪
Their names are remembered and hallowed for centuries.

300
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,855
也算是种不朽      真的?
It's a sort of immortality. Really?

301
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,773
说说看 这些赞助人做过什么?
What did these benefactors do?

302
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,570
就说威廉·德·维尔爵士 他的纹章和大名刻在教堂里
Take Sir William de Vere, his coat of arms are there and in chapel.

303
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,211
他在15世纪从贝利撤走了一支军队
He diverted the baronial army away from Baillie in the 15th century.

304
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,339
转而驻扎到了圣乔治学院
He had the soldiers billetted at St George's College.

305
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,252
我不知道还有圣乔治学院呢
I didn't know there was a St George's.

306
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,536
没有 从那之后就没有了
There isn't. Not since that.

307
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,414
再说乔治·蒙克顿
Then, there's George Monkton,

308
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,378
蒙克顿学院就是以他命名的
whom Monkton Quad's named after.

309
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,738
他阻止了克伦威尔融化全校银器
He stopped Cromwell melting all the college silverdown

310
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,652
来抵他新模范军的粮饷
to pay for his army.

311
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,729
他告诉他们 剑桥大学圣三一学院的银器要好得多
He told them the silverwas better quality at Trinity, Cambridge!

312
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,091
今后恐怕都没有学院可凭吊了
Now, it looks like there'll be no college left to remember.

313
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,971
当然 除非解决外国学生的问题
Unless we can solve the problem of overseas students.

314
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,495
当然 人总是愿意
Well, of course, one would like to...

315
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,218
自得其乐的...
help oneself.

316
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,338
呃...帮助他人
Er... help one's friends.

317
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,968
帮助学院
Help the college.

318
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,974
这与荣誉无关      当然 有此一念天理不容
Nothing to do with the honour. Of course not! Ignoble thought.

319
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,133
大臣坚信政治家的天职就是帮助他人
The Minister believes it's a politician's duty to help others.

320
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,939
完全正确 一语中的
Absolutely. Name of the game.

321
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,013
这才是搞政治的原因 帮助别人
That's why we go into politics, to help others.

322
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,251
我是个理想主义者 不为名不为利
I'm an idealist, nothing to do with the honour.

323
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,810
就我所见 荣誉都是身后之事
Most of the honour comes after you're dead.

324
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,893
可是等你入了土 你的名字铭刻在银烛台上
Not much satisfaction from having your name on the silversconce

325
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,132
也没多大意义了
when you're six feet under!

326
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,931
顺便 院长 说点别的
Incidentally, Master, to change the subject completely...

327
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,292
什么时候颁发荣誉博士学位?
when do you award your honorary doctorates?

328
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,692
颁证仪式还得几个月 但人选要在两周之内决定
The ceremonys not fora few month butwe have to decide in two weeks

329
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,579
荣誉博士?      人选还没定?
Doctorate? Aren't they decided?

330
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,891
还有个法学名誉博士空缺
There is one Doctorate of Law still to be decided.

331
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,770
不知该给一位法官呢 还是政府官员
We're wondering whether it should go to a judge or in Government

332
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,408
法官?
Judge?

333
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,258
才不用给法官颁法学博士呢
You don't want to make a judge a Doctor of Law!

334
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,208
是政治家制定法律 实施法律
The politicians make the laws and pass the laws.

335
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,612
没有政治家 法官们根本没法审判
If it wasn't for politicians, the judges wouldn't be able to judge.

336
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,817
无法可依 懂我意思吧?
There'd be no laws to judge!

337
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,857
当然当然      完全理解
Yes, indeed. Quite!

338
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,695
他们会无事可做 失业法官排成排
They'd have nothing to do. Queues of unemployed judges...

339
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,134
扣着可笑的假发
in silly wigs!

340
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,730
法官多好过
It's all right for judges.

341
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,690
他们不必讨好电视制片人 对记者撒谎
They don't have to suck up to TV producers, lie to journalists.

342
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,648
也不用假装喜欢内阁那些同僚
They don't have to pretend to like their Cabinet colleagues.

343
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,936
不然呢...我跟你们说...
I'll tell you something else...

344
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,210
要是法官得忍受我那些内阁同僚
if judges had to put up with some of my colleagues,

345
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,089
他们明天就会恢复死刑
they'd bring capital punishment back tomorrow!

346
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,618
恢复了正好
Bloody good job, too!

347
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,214
还有件事我得说
I'll tell you anotherthing...

348
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,736
我没法把他关进大牢
I can't send him to prison.

349
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,535
没法把他关进大牢
Can't send him to prison.

350
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,330
我要是法官 先把小汉关起来再说
If I were a judge, I could whiz old Humpy off to the Scrubs.

351
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,896
脚不落地 拖着就走 手铐咣的一声 三年后见
Feetwouldn't touch. Clang bang! See you in three years.

352
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,813
若诚心悔过 减刑三分之一
One third remission forgood conduct.

353
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,811
我整不了他
I can't do that!

354
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,776
还非得听他的话
I have to listen to him.

355
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,659
哦 老天
Oh, God!

356
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,258
他就念叨念叨念叨念叨
On and on and on!

357
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,538
有些句子比杰弗里大法官还要长
Some of his sentences are longer than Judge Jeffreys'!

358
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,055
不不不 政治家更该受奖赏
No, no, no. Politicians are much more deserving.

359
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,530
你们可不能给法官荣誉学位
You don't want to give your doctory honourates to judges.

360
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,213
千万不能
Definitely not!

361
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,217
至理名言啊 大臣
Beautifully argued, Minister.

362
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,419
我想通了 是不应该给法官
I see now... we shouldn't give it to a judge.

363
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,092
您方才讲得无比专业      简直如同法学博士 大臣
You put the case most expertly. Almost like a Doctor of Law.

364
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,809
我此时仿佛看到 您站在谢尔登礼堂里
I can see you there now in the Sheldonian,

365
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,017
绯红长袍加身 风华绝代
standing there in those magnificent crimson robes,

366
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,049
在诸位学术英杰面前接受博士学位
receiving doctorate in front of an assembly of eminent scholars.

367
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,734
太好了      棒极了
Wonderful. Marvellous.

368
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,972
你会说到这个 真有意思
How funny you should say that.

369
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,450
我刚巧也想着同样的场面呢
I was just thinking the same thing.

370
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,213
早安 大臣 早安 伯纳
Morning, Minister. Morning, Bernard.

371
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,931
昨天的晚宴真愉快 大臣
Most enjoyable dinner last night.

372
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,537
会议之前我想和您私下聊几句 抱歉 伯纳
I wonder if we could have a private chat. Forgive us, Bernard.

373
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,859
大臣
Minister...

374
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,209
贝利学院的院长让我问您
The master of Baillie has asked me to enquire

375
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,373
您是否有兴趣接受牛津荣誉法学博士学位
whether you'd accept an honorary doctorate of law.

376
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,898
我? 天哪
Me? Good heavens!

377
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,097
当然 这并不是收买您      当然不是
It's... not an offer. No, of course not.

378
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,412
自然 众所周知 您反感勋位
Of course, in view of your well-known hostility to honours...

379
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,299
别犯傻 汉弗莱 这是两码事
Don't be silly. This is quite different.

380
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,811
不完全是 大臣
Not entirely, Minister.

381
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,974
要知道 您这可是无功受禄 不是"挣来"的
It's a matter of accepting it without doing anything to deserve it,

382
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,053
正如您自己会直言不讳的那样
as you might put it in your refreshingly blunt fashion.

383
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,496
我是内阁大臣
I'm a Cabinet Minister!

384
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,248
您不是领薪水了吗?      对 可...不是
Isn't that what you're paid for? Yes, but... No!

385
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,453
对 可是...
Yes, but...

386
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,535
那是政府秘密投票 我又没法拒绝      当然当然
I cant refuse avote of confidence in the Government, not just oneself.

387
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,329
没错 但我说过 事还没定 这个...
No, quite. As I say, it's not certain, it's...

388
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,538
汉弗莱 还有件事      什么 大臣?
Humphrey, to change the subject completely,

389
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,251
我愿尽力帮助贝利学院 解决外国学生问题
Id like to do what I can for Baillie in overseas students business

390
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,012
哦 太好了
Oh, good!

391
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,616
但我的借口...理由呢?
Butwouldn't I need a pretext... a reason?

392
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,691
不必 大臣 没有问题
No, Minister, no problem.

393
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,819
据我所知 皇室正受到某些非洲领导人的压力
The Palace has been under pressure from certain African leaders.

394
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,050
自然不能让皇室为难
We can't embarrass the Palace,

395
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,611
因此可以重新指定贝利学院为英联邦教育中心
so we'll redesignate Baillie as a Commonwealth Education Centre.

396
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,013
可经费从哪来? 我要求各方面都削减5%预算
But where am I to find the money? Im set on 5% cuts across the board

397
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,651
如果这里开口 那就刹不住了
If that's achieved, anything's possible.

398
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,529
大臣 经费调查委员会来了      好的伯纳 带他们进来
The committee are waiting. Very well, show them in.

399
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,251
大臣 照我说 本部门还是能节约的
I suppose we could achieve the cuts in this department,

400
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,574
只要不把它联系到勋章就行了
if the absurd idea of linking honours to cuts were to be shelved.

401
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,174
我明白了      好的
I see. Yes...

402
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,255
谢谢 伯纳      早安
Thank you, Bernard. Morning.

403
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,571
首先回顾上次会议内容      好的
Now, minutes of the previous meeting?

404
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,212
好 上次议程包括 办公设施
Matters arising: Accommodation.

405
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,018
哦 对了
Oh, yes!

406
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,537
很高兴告诉大家 我们能削减5%经费
I'm happy to be able to tell you that we have found a 5 % cut,

407
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,129
只要出售海威库姆那幢老办公楼
by selling an office in High Wycombe.

408
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,131
哦 真的?      没错
Oh, really? Yes.

409
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,336
不错 太好了      是啊
Yes, very good. Yes.

410
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,899
文具购置呢?
Stationery acquisition?

411
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,815
是的 我们有种新的盘货制度 能减少年度支出
We've discovered a new stock control system to reduce expenditure.

412
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,370
减多少?      大约5% 对吗?
