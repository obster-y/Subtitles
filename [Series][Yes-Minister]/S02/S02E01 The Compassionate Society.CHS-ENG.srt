仁爱社会

5
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,840
今天忙什么呢 先生?      内阁开会
What is it today, sir?           The Ministry.

6
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,441
一上午讨论公共医疗卫生的事
All morning on Health service administration.

7
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,960
啊 收音机里刚刚还在播
A chap just now on the radio

8
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,243
说公共医疗 教育和卫生的问题
said the trouble with health,education and transport

9
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:04,600
在于政府官员都去私立医院
is that people in Governmentgo to private hospitals

10
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,723
把孩子送去私立学校      好好
and send their kidsto private schools.        Very good.

11
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,605
喜剧节目吧?
Comedy programme, was it?

12
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,757
上班都坐公家车
And go to workin chauffeur-driven cars.

13
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:18,118
多少有点道理吧 先生?
Think there's something in it, sir?

14
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,516
如果您和汉弗莱爵士搭公交上班
If you and Sir Humphreywent to work on a number 27...

15
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,004
不切实际
Quite impracticable!

16
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,651
我们工作时间够长了
We work long enough hours as it is,

17
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,681
哪有空等公交
without having to wait at bus stops.

18
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:31,520
你们需要更有效率的公交      可不是
You'd need more efficient buses.Certainly would.

19
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:34,722
对 广播也是这么说的
Yes, that's what he was saying.

20
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:39,724
医疗系统也一样 您加入联合福利协会了吧 先生?
Same with the Health Service.You a member of BUPA, sir?

21
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:43,321
现在在播什么 罗伊?      "昨日议会" 先生
Anything on the radio, Roy?"Yesterday in Parliament".

22
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,043
还是算了...
Don't bother...

23
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,595
兰弗先生 伯明翰的反对党成员
Mr Lanford,opposition member for Birmingham,

24
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,882
询问行政事务大臣吉姆·哈克
asked the AdministrativeAffairs Minister, James Hacker,

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,560
公共医疗行政减员一事
about reducing administratorsin the Health Service.

26
00:01:56,205 --> 00:02:00,721
是的 我们已经削减了11.3%
We have already achieveda reduction of 11.3 %

27
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,115
书记和管理人员
in administrative staff

28
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:06,561
经济效益正在稳步提高
and are actively pursuingfurther economies.

29
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,604
大臣能否解释一下您对下院的保证
Would you explainhow his assurance to the House

30
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:15,680
为何与您部里的会议记录不同?
squares with this minutefrom his own department?

31
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,474
于是 兰弗先生戏剧化地拿出一张纸
Then Mr Lanford dramaticallyproduced a paper.

32
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,194
原文:"如果将行政人员重新分类"
I quote,"If admin staff were reclassified

33
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:25,674
"改为技术头衔"
from administrativeto technical...

34
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:31,995
"单位由财政年转为公历年"
and the comparison changedfrom the financial to calendar year,

35
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,444
"统计数字就会减少11.3%"
then the figures will showa fall of 11.3 %".

36
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,200
大臣能否解释一下这阴谋诡计?
Would the Minister care to commenton this shabby deception?

37
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,044
上套了 先生
Bit of a googly, sir.

38
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:49,361
我...我...
I... I...

39
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,837
我对你手里那张纸一无所知
I have no knowledge of the documentyou're brandishing.

40
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,561
我愿意向大臣提供文件
I shall givethe file reference to the Minister

41
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:04,083
来交换一次完全独立的调查
in exchange for an assuranceof a full independent enquiry.

42
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,721
我保证发起调查
I will give that assurance.

43
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:12,844
下院宣读了苏格兰渔业法案
The Houseread the Scottish Fisheries'Bill...

44
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,441
不好办啊 "独立调查"
That's a bit rough, innit?"A full independent enquiry"!

45
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:21,843
您被套进去了      我觉得我逃脱了
You were dropped in it there.I think I got away with it.

46
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:26,237
幸好他们没问圣爱医院的事 先生      为什么?
Lucky they didn't ask youabout that new hospital, sir.Why?

47
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:31,320
完工了15个月 还没有病人
They finished it 15 months ago,and it's still got no patients.

48
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,397
一定是卫生部没钱请员工
The DHSS can't afford to staff it.

49
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:38,194
有员工 500名行政人员
It's got staff, 500 administrators.

50
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,560
只缺病人      谁告诉你的?
Just no patients.Who told you?

51
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,115
我朋友查理 卫生部长的司机
My mate Charlie,a driver for the Health Secretary.

52
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,876
汉弗莱 我太震惊了      我也是 大臣
I'm appalled!           So am I.

53
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,922
玩忽职守 太不像话
The incompetence of it!

54
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,599
就是 真不知您中了什么邪
I can't think what came over you.

55
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,278
你说什么
I beg your pardon!

56
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:01,121
完全独立的调查?      汉弗莱 我不是说这个
A full independent enquiry.Humphrey, that's not what I meant.

57
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:04,402
您说玩忽职守      我是说你 汉弗莱
But you mentioned incompetence.Yours, Humphrey, yours!

58
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,803
我 大臣?     你害我套进去的
Mine?           You dropped me into it?

59
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,765
我们不能总面面俱到
We can't foresee a small omissionfrom the brief,

60
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,800
可是独立调查?
but a full enquiry?

61
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:16,924
我也不想被调查 但如果你落水了 有绳子就抓
I don'twant an enquiry, but ifyou're drowning and thrown a rope...

62
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,838
这不是绳子 这是绞索
That wasn't a rope, it was a noose!

63
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,200
职责要求您站在部里的立场上
You should've stood upfor the department!

64
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:25,357
不 汉弗莱 我为昨天的质询做了万全准备
I prepared thoroughlyfor yesterday's Question Time,

65
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:29,404
偏不知道你在玩弄数据
but nowhere was the suggestionyou'd juggled the figures

66
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,476
让我误导下院
so I'd mislead the House.

67
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:36,560
大臣 您吩咐减少行政人员数目 我们就减少数目
You wanted the figures reduced?So we reduced the figures!

68
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:41,196
对 但没减少行政人员      当然没有
Yes, but not the administrators.Of course not.

69
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:46,234
这不是我的本意      大臣 我们可没有心灵感应
That's not what I meant.Minister, one isn't a mind-reader!

70
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:49,761
您说减数目 我们就减数目      还有一件事
You said reduce them, so we did.And another thing:

71
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:52,393
他们怎么知道的?又一次泄漏?
How did this get out?Another leak?

72
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,562
这哪是行政部 简直是漏锅
This isn't a department,it's a colander!

73
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,682
什么都告诉后座议员
How can we govern responsibly,

74
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,082
怎能权责分明?
if back benchers get all the facts?

75
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:06,080
调查给了我们缓冲时间      那就是定时炸弹
The enquiry gives us some time.So does a time-bomb.

76
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,884
有没有抢险队?      抢险队?
Is there a disposal squad?Disposal squad?

77
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:12,879
能否让独立调查为我们开脱?
Couldn't we get the independentenquiry to exonerate us?

78
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:18,238
您想操纵调查?      没有没有
Do you mean rig it?No, no, no, no!

79
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,997
这个...对
Well... yes.

80
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,004
大臣
Minister!

81
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,319
这取决于主席是谁
It depends on who the chairman is.

82
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:28,795
他一定得可靠      怎么个可靠法?
He absolutely has to be sound.Sound?

83
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:34,358
得有觉悟 一点就通
He will knowwhat is required.He will perceive the implications.

84
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,234
有洞察力 对我们抱同情
He will have a sympathetic insightinto the problems.

85
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,283
总而言之 他得可靠
In short, he will be "sound".

86
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,197
你是说...收买他?
You mean... bent?

87
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:45,356
不 当然不是
No, of course not!

88
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,676
他得自己心胸宽大
He will be a manof broad understanding.

89
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,518
那就...找退休政客?
How about... a retired politician?

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,358
正直得无懈可击
And unimpeachable integrity.

91
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,720
对 我懂你的意思
Yes, I see what you mean.

92
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:59,001
商人?      哦 开玩笑
A businessman?Oh, really!

93
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:02,123
学者?      不 不 不
An academic?No, no, no.

94
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:07,359
你想找谁?      我想 退休公务员也许可以
Who've you got in mind?Perhaps a retired civil servant.

95
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:11,404
好主意 汉弗莱      莫里斯·威廉爵士
Good thinking, Humphrey.Sir Maurice Williams.

96
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,715
他不会太独立吧?
Might not he be too independent?

97
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,798
他想要个贵族头衔      就靠这个?
Well, he's hoping for a peerage.Not through this?

98
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:21,799
不 可是出对了结论能攒工分
No, but the right findingwill earn him Brownie points!

99
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,719
工分?      攒够了换徽章嘛
Brownie points?They all add up towards the badge!

100
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,322
好吧 就找莫里斯爵士      谢谢您 大臣
Well, Sir Maurice it is.Thank you, Minister.

101
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:32,919
谢谢 大队长
Thank you... Brown Owl.

102
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,915
早安 伯纳
Good morning, Bernard.

103
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:43,155
两件事 首先是古巴难民      又来了
Two points, the Cuban refugees.Not that again?

104
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:46,681
关于我们拒绝出台更多优惠政策
It's about our refusalto do any more for them.

105
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:50,633
不怪我 怪财政部 谁能对抗财政部      没错
It's not my fault, it's the Treasury.You can't beat the Treasury!

106
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,602
我不表态
I shall say nothing.

107
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,020
再公开丢一次脸
One more public humiliation

108
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,283
我自己都成政治难民了
and I'llbecome a political refugee myself.

109
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:02,836
还有一件呢?      您问伦敦北郊那间空壳医院
And the other point?The alleged empty hospital.

110
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,964
对对      我提醒过您 司机消息网并不完全可靠
As I warned you, the driver's networkis not wholly reliable.

111
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,037
罗伊说错了      谢天谢地
Roy's wrong.Thank heavens forthat!

112
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:13,993
怎么查到的?      私人秘书消息网
How did you find out?The private secretaries' network.

113
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,484
详情呢?
And?

114
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:20,355
实际上医院里行政人员只有342名
In fact, there are only 342administrative staff at the hospital.

115
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,916
其他170人是门房 清洁工 洗衣工和厨子之类
The other 170 are porters, cleaners,laundry workers, cooks, etc.

116
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,643
医护人员呢?
And medical staff?

117
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,875
那倒没有
Oh, none of them.

118
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,079
没有?      没有
None?             No!

119
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,043
伯纳 我们说的是圣爱医院吧?
We are talkingabout St Edward's Hospital?

120
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,958
是 刚落成15个月 人员齐备
Yes. It's brand-new and fully-staffed.

121
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,844
不幸赶上政府削减预算
Unfortunately, there were cutbacks,

122
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,963
所以没钱开展医疗了
so there was no moneyfor medical services.

123
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,834
一家新医院 500名行政人员 没医生 没病人?
A hospital with over 500 non-medicalstaff and no patients?

124
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:50,041
有一名病人      一名?
There's one patient.One?

125
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:54,403
副主管绊在脚手架上 摔断了腿
The deputy administrator fell overscaffolding and broke his leg.

126
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,123
老天爷
Good God!

127
00:07:56,285 --> 00:08:00,403
幸好下院没问 为什么消息没泄漏?
Thank heavens I wasn't askedabout this! Why hasn't it got out?

128
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,762
实际上 它被打扮成工地
It's been contrivedto look like a building site,

129
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:07,076
至今没人发现它开业了
and so far no one's realisedit's operational!

130
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,521
像脚手架 水泥车 正常工程用品
You know, scaffolding, skips,the normal thing?

131
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:14,674
正常?我得赶在反对党前面去看看
Normal? I'd better look at itbefore the opposition does.

132
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,121
对 很奇怪媒体还没发现
Yes, it's surprisingthe press haven't found out.

133
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,118
伯纳 幸好大多数记者素质底下
Fortunately, most journalistsare so incompetent,

134
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,879
大概连今天星期三都不知道
they wouldn't knowtoday is Wednesday.

135
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,003
今天是星期四 大臣
It's actually Thursday, Minister.

136
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,680
就坐那边
Let's sit down there.

137
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,678
你们大臣干吗对圣爱医院感兴趣?
Why is your Minister interestedin this hospital?

138
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:40,474
他很担心那里没病人
He's greatly concernedthat it has no patients.

139
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,398
林子大了      就是
It takes all sorts.           Yes.

141
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:51,634
没有医护人员哪来的病人?      就是

汉弗莱爵士      谢谢
Sir Humphrey?Thank you.

144
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:05,203
卫生部认为开业需要时间
We've found at the DHSSthat it takes time to get things going.

145
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,881
首先得安排好
First of all, you have to sort out

146
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,081
日常运转
the smooth running of the hospital.

147
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,333
收治病人可不能改善现状
Having patients aroundwould be no help at all.

148
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,039
他们只会碍事
They'd just be in the way.

149
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:23,643
告诉他现在是磨合期      对 磨合期
Tell him this is the run-in period.Yes, yes, the run-in period.

150
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,562
要磨合多久?你看
How long is the run-in periodgoing to last?

151
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,603
我们大臣承诺发起独立调查
My Minister's agreedto an independent enquiry.

152
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,963
你知道我最恨这个      我知道 可是...
You knowwhat I think about that.Yes, I know, but...

153
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:40,719
我们会给圣爱医院找些病人
We are going to getsome patients in to St Edward's...

154
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,197
终究会吧?
eventually?

155
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:45,797
不是吗?
Aren't we?

156
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,956
有可能
It's possible.

157
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,523
确实有这个意向
Certainly our present intention.

158
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,596
一两年之内
In a year or two.

159
00:09:56,525 --> 00:10:00,677
大概...等财政状况改善点
Probably... when the financialsituation has eased up a bit.

160
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,278
此前不会吗?      不
Not till then?            No

161
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:06,723
到处都在关闭 怎能破例开40个新病房?
How can I open 40 new wardswhen I'm closing everywhere else?

162
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:11,879
财政部和内阁都会反对      我们大臣可能要关闭它
Treasury wouldn't wear it.My Minister may want to shut the place.

163
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,240
不可能 工会怎么办?
Impossible! What about the unions?

164
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:19,203
已经有工会了?      这倒是
Are the unions active there yet?Good point.

165
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:25,757
记得在萨瑟医院煽风点火那人吗?
Remember that fire brand agitatorat Southwark Hospital?

166
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:30,323
比利·弗雷泽 讨厌鬼 可能有用
Billy Fraser, odious man.Could be useful.

167
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:33,124
该放他出马了
Time he was moved on.

168
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:41,156
卫生部门正在官僚之路上高歌猛进
The Health Service is an advancedcase of galloping bureaucracy!

169
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,237
怎能说高歌猛进
Oh, certainly not galloping!

170
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,715
最多算稳步前进
A gentle canterat the most.

171
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:53,003
每天有报告涌进来 对吧伯纳      哪来的 大臣?
Instances flood into this office.From whom, Minister?

172
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:56,441
议员 选民 医生 护士 公众
MPs, constituents,doctors, nurses, the public.

173
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,436
刁民
Trouble makers!

174
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,403
公众?      他们最不安分
The public?They're the worst.

175
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,398
听听这个
Listen to this.

176
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:06,637
"申请听诊器:基于目前状况"
"Stethoscope requisition:Due to current situation,

177
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,878
"无法按需核发听诊器"

"但可以为现有听诊器"
We can, however,supply longertubes

179
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:17,239
"配备更长的胶管"
for your existing stethoscopes".

180
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:21,714
怎么了?      你不觉得奇怪吗?
Well?Doesn't that strike you as odd?

181
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,843
不 如果增加胶管...      不 不
Lf they have long tubes...No, no.

182
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:28,475
他们不要长胶管 要听诊器
No, not longer stethoscopes,MORE stethoscopes.

183
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,318
如果胶管够长
If they had really long tubes,

184
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:36,400
医生可以坐在原地 听遍所有病人
the doctor could stand in one placeand listen to all the chests.

185
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,281
这个呢? "护士制服"
What about nurses' uniforms?

186
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,801
"显然目前标准制服"
"Apparently the latestconsignment of nurses' coats

187
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:50,117
"均以半透明材料制作"

189
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,556
"评估问题严重程度"
who will assessthe extent of the problem".

190
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:04,116
这倒是个美差      汉弗莱 我说真的!
Nice work if you can get it.Humphrey, I'm serious!

191
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:10,403
"请注意 柔软型卫生纸专供病人而非职工"
"Please note that the soft toiletrolls are for patients not staff.

192
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:15,355
"似乎近来职工在用柔软型卫生纸"
It would appear that staff havebeen using the soft toilet rolls

193
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,198
"作此种或彼种用途"
for one reason or another".

194
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:23,997
"圣史蒂芬太平间圣诞期间将关闭"
"St Stephen's Mortuarywill be closed over Christmas.

195
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:27,362
"节日期间 请医护人员"
During the holiday,medical staff are to cooperate

196
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,517
"减轻太平间负担"
in keeping pressureoff this department".

197
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,843
非常合理 情有可原
A very civil and reasonable request.

198
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:40,159
平常医生该让太平间繁荣昌盛吗?
You think the rest of the yeardoctors work hard to keep it busy?

199
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,523
大臣 这些都是特例
These are a few isolated examples.

200
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:48,964
大体上 医疗部门已达到政府最高效率
The Health Service is as efficientas the Government allows it.

201
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,037
胡说 汉弗莱 看数字就知道
Nonsense!The figures speak for themselves.

202
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:57,233
10年来 医疗部门行政人员增加了4万名
In ten years, the number ofadministrators has risen by 40,000.

203
00:12:57,405 --> 00:13:00,841
病床减少了6万张
The number of hospital bedshas fallen by 60,000.

204
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:07,001
医疗年度支出增加了1500万 净增长
The annual cost of the HealthService has gone up by ?.5 billion!

205
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:11,158
工业增长也有这个速度就好了
If only British industrycould match this growth record.

206
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,204
你觉得多拨款少治病人
You think spendingmore money on fewer patients

207
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,799
余钱拿来雇行政人员
so we can employmore administrators

208
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:22,038
是对国会和纳税人负责吗?
is a good way of spendingthe taxpayer's money?

209
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,274
当然
Certainly.

210
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:27,120
汉弗莱 拨款是为了把病人治好 要专款专用
This money is solelyto make sick people better.

211
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,163
不不 大臣
No, no, no, Minister.

212
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,885
是为了我们大家好
It is to make everybody better.

213
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,402
更好体现大家的关注与仁爱之心
Better for showing the extentof their care and compassion.

214
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:42,844
您看 当款项集中投入医疗或社会服务
You see, when money is allocatedto the Health orSocial Services,

215
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,395
议会和国民都觉得...升华了
Parliament and the countryfeel...cleansed.

216
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:51,239
净化了 赎罪了 这是种牺牲
Purified. Absolved. It is a sacrifice.

217
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,043
花言巧语
Dreadful claptrap!

218
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,000
牺牲仪式之后
After the sacrifice is made,

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,283
没人会问祭品去了哪里
nobody questionswhat happened to the offering.

220
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,198
汉弗莱 你错了 公众确实反对滥用
The public does careif it's misspent.

221
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:05,880
恕我直言 他们反对公开滥用
They care it's not seento be misspent.

222
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,755
才不是呢 看看那桩精神病院丑闻
That's not true. Look at the uproarover mental hospital scandals.

223
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,802
正是如此 大臣
My point exactly.

224
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,480
顺顺当当浪费了多少年 几十年
Those abuses had been going onhappily for years.

225
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,638
没人关心钱花到哪去了
Nobody was concernedwhat was being done with their money.

226
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,273
他们只恨知道了真相
What outraged themwas being told.

227
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,197
汉弗莱 多世故的烟幕弹
A cynical smokescreen!

228
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,008
你我都同意
Are we or are we not agreed

229
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,678
医院不能专养行政人员吧?
there's no pointin a hospital run solelyforthe staff?

230
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:35,839
我不会这么说      我会
That's not how I would express it.It's how I would.

231
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,199
确实
Indeed.

232
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:42,475
那你怎么说?      当然 总的来说
How would you express it?At the end of the day,

233
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,762
治病救人是医院的职能之一
one of a hospital's prime functionsis patient care.

234
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,244
之一?还有什么?
One?

235
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:51,318
没有钱请医护人员
Until we have the moneyfor nursing and medical staff,

236
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,524
这一职能18个月内不能履行
it's a function we can't pursue.In 18 months orso...

237
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,882
18个月?      届时可以开些病房
18 months?We can open some wards.

238
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,400
不行 汉弗莱 必须现在病房全开
No, it's got to be now.

239
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,035
好吧 那就组成部门联席委员会
I suppose we could forman inter-departmental committee

240
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,322
考察提早收治病人
to examine the feasibilityof monitoring a proposal

241
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,158
这一提案的可行性
for admitting patients earlier.

242
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,642
出结果要多久?      不久
How long would that take to report?Not long.

243
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:19,241
多久?      大概18个月
How long?About 18 months.

244
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:23,560
我提议裁掉所有人员
I suggestwe get ridof all the staff there

245
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:28,241
省下钱开放其他医院闲置病房      大臣
and use the money to openclosed wards in other hospitals.

246
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:33,798
等有钱了 再给圣爱医院配备医生开业 您可同意?
When we can afford it, we openSt Edward's with medical staff.

247
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,753
大臣 如此您把开业时间推后了好几年
Do that and you'll delaythe opening for patients for years.

248
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,281
为什么      您觉得没病人 行政人员就闲着?
Why?You talk as if the staffhave nothing to do!

249
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:43,800
有什么事      拜托 大臣
What do they do?Really, Minister!

00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:34,237
医院干什么的?看病!
That is what a hospital's for.Patients!

282
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:37,317
悬壶济世 治病救人
Ill people! Healing the sick!

283
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:43,162
可是大臣 这些基本工作和病人不相干
But all these vital tasks mustbe done with or without patients.

284
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,756
为什么?

285
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,563

我不明白
I don't understand.

287
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,844
还得怎么说?为什么?
How else can I express it? Why?

288
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,678
不打仗您就遣散军队吗?
Would you sack the armybecause there's no war?

289
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:02,679
两码事 医院必须出效益
Completely different!A hospital must produce results.

290
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:08,477
大臣 效益不看结果 得看行动 现在医院很景气
We don't measure our successby results but by activity.

291
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:13,002
这500人已经操劳过度了
Those 500 peopleare seriously overworked.

292
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:19,041
预计编制有650人
The full establishmentshould be 650.

293

您要看医院的报告吗?
May I show you the paperwork?

294
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:25,036
不 汉弗莱 我看够了 全部裁掉

00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,557
办不到 大臣
Out of the question, Minister.

296
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:32,240
没有行政人员 医院永不能开业
We need administratorsor the hospital will never open.

297
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,875
裁掉后勤工人      也不行 工会不同意
Sack the ancillary staff.The unions won'twear it.

298
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:40,914
各裁一半 省下钱来请医生护士
Sack half and use the moneyto get doctors and nurses,

299
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,440
开几个病房

00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,439
不 汉弗莱 这是我的底线 底线!
No, Humphrey, that's my lastword.My lastword!

301
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,675
你可以走了

很好 大臣 我去和医疗工会协商

但我不抱希望      快走
But I don't hold out much hope.Go!

我们不占理 就照你的来
Not much of a case.Can't fight you on it.

313
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,955
什么意思?
What do you mean?

314
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:49,358
我们承认不能在空壳医院里养后勤人员
We realise you can't keep ancillarystaff on in an empty hospital.

315
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:52,723
会不会太悲观了?
Isn't that a bit defeatist?

316
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:55,681
什么?
What?

317
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:59,440
你们不会不管他们吧?      你是说...
Surely, you can stick up forthem?You want us to...?

318
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:02,722
可不是你们一方的事
It's not just your workers, you know?

319
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:08,323
那342名公务员得有人可管理
The 342 civil servants must havesome workers to administer.

320
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:13,320
怎会裁到公务员头上?      时世艰难啊
Civil servants are never laid off.We live in disturbing times.

321
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,960
你是说 我们全行业反抗 你会支持?
You mean, if we take industrialaction, you'll support us?

322
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,435
亲爱的布赖恩 我是常任秘书
My dear Brian,I am the Permanent Secretary.

323

我的职责是维持政府运转
My task is to turnthe wheels of government.

324
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,115
我怎么能支持罢工呢
I couldn't possibly countenanceany such action.

325
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,601
不过...如果各位工友
But... if there wereeffective opposition

326
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,120
强烈施压
from the ancillary workers,

327
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,004
公务员也会支持
the civil servantswould have to stay.

328

大臣呢?
And the Minister?

大臣自己连蓝领白领都分不清
The Ministerdoesn't knowhis ACAS from his NALGO.

330

会员都认命了
They're resigned to it by now.

336

比利·弗雷泽也认命啦?

那就不一样了 工人们就缺人撑腰壮胆
Well, that's a different matter,with some real shop-floor militancy.

It's appalling it's not used!No, a very good thing in some ways.

管理500人是个大工程 大臣
Running an organisationof 500 people is a big job.

但没有人就没有工作了嘛      什么?
But if they weren't here,they wouldn't be here!

359
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,875
这不对头 不能这样下去
This is wrong. It won't do.

360
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:33,117
再不收病人 我就关闭医院
Either get some patientsor I'll close it.

361
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:38,234
总有一天 大臣...      别"总有一天" 马上!
Well, in the course of time...Not in the course of time. Now!

You mean 300 jobs lost?          Yes, I do.

医院不是就业处 它是治病用的
A hospital is a placefor healing of the sick!

373
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:29,804
它是我们会员的衣食父母 你要裁掉他们
It's employment for my members,and you want to sack them.

374
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,559
这算哪门子"仁爱社会"?
Is that your compassionate society?

375
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,717
对病人仁爱 不是对你们会员
Compassionate to patientsrather than your members!

376

How can you do this to patients?It's Mr Hackerthat's doing it.

401
