4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
两害相权

5
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,885
真让人忍无可忍
It's absolutely intolerable.

6
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:50,285
是 大臣     当然 大臣
Yes, Minister. Quite so, Minister.

7
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:55,927
本来那些部门零敲碎打 各买各的文字处理设备
Each department about to order different word-processing equipment,

8
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:02,443
是我说服他们 由行政部出面下团购订单
and I persuaded them to place one big central order for everyone

9
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:07,484
金额大到能让英国厂家投资开发新设备
big enough for UK manufacturers to invest in systems development.

10
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,044
是 大臣     跟你们说也是白说
Yes, Minister. I don't have to tell you.

11
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,694
是白说 大臣
No, Minister.

12
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,212
谈判几个月 眼看就能发布特大新闻
Months of negotiation and we were nere a press announcement:

13
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,572
"哈克大力投资现代科技"
"Hacker's massive investment in modern technology."

14
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,613
"吉姆的国民工业信任票"
"Jim's vote of confidence in British industry."

15
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,289
"英国制造能行 吉姆说"
"'Britain can make it,' says Jim."

16
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:27,013
当然 大臣     是 大臣
Quite so.

17
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:32,090
布鲁塞尔突然发出指令 叫欧共体成员
And now this directive from Brussels saying all EEC members

18
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:36,453
全体遵循那些麻烦的欧洲标准
must conform to some niggling European word-processing standards

19
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:40,813
必须赞成欧共体委员会的计划
that we have to agree to the plans of committees

20
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:45,526
还要开欧洲文字处理设备大会 在布鲁塞尔
at the forthcoming Word-Processing Conference in Brussels.

21
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,890
哎 说话啊
Well, say something!

22
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,050
是 大臣     当然
Yes, Minister. Quite so.

23
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,728
就这样?
Is that all?

24
00:01:55,895 --> 00:02:00,810
大臣 恐怕我们假装欧洲人 总得受点惩罚
That's the penalty we pay for pretending we're Europeans.

25
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,443
我完全明白您对欧洲的敌意
I fully understand your hostility to Europe.

26
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:07,893
我不像你 汉弗莱 我是亲欧洲 反欧共体
I'm not like you, Humphrey. I'm pro-Europe, just anti-Brussels.

27
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:11,127
有时我觉得你倒是反欧洲 亲欧共体
I sometimes think you're anti-Europe and pro-Brussels.

28
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,889
大臣 我既不亲谁 也不反谁
I'm neither pronor antianything.

29
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:18,845
我只是卑微的社会公器 盛放您深思熟虑的果实
I'm merely a humble vessel for the fruits of your deliberations

30
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:23,611
但可以看出 考虑到大欧洲理念的荒谬
It could be argued that given the absurdity of the idea,

31
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:27,211
欧盟已尽力辩不可辩之理
that Brussels does its best to defend the indefensible

32
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,493
行不可行之事     话不能这么说 汉弗莱
and make the unworkable work. That's not true, Humphrey!

33
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,933
不是我浮夸 靠着欧洲理念
Without sounding pompous

34
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,933
我们才能超越狭隘的国家利益
we must avoid narrow national self-interest.

35
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,404
一点都不浮夸     很好
It doesn't sound pompous... Good.

36
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,167
只是不准确罢了
Merely inaccurate.

37
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,050
听好了 卑微的社会公器
Listen, humble vessel,

38
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:48,049
欧洲各国本是一体 致力于同一个目标
Europe is a community of nations dedicated towards one goal.

39
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,806
什么这么好笑 汉弗莱?
May we share the joke?

40
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,284
大臣 我们客观地来看
Minister, let's look at this objectively.

41
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:59,210
这是各国利益的博弈场 我们为什么加入?
It's a game played for national interests. Why did we go in?

42
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,287
为了加强自由西方国家的联盟
To strengthen the free Western nations.

43
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:06,767
大臣 是为了离间德法 从而压倒法国
We went in to screw the French, splitting them from the Germans.

44
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:12,534
那法国呢?     为保护他们没用的农民免遭竞争
Why did the French? Protect their farmers from competition.

45
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:16,847
德国不是吧?     他们是为洗清种族灭绝的罪名
And the Germans? To cleanse themselves of genocide

46
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:19,893
请求重新加入人类社会
and apply for re-admission to the human race.

47
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,250
这也太尖酸刻薄了
I've never heard such cynicism!

48
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,088
那些小国总不是为自身利益吧?
The small nations didn't join for selfish reasons.

49
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,247
是吗? 卢森堡是为了赏钱
Really? Luxembourg is in it for the perks.

50
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:32,203
作为欧共体首都 外国资金滚滚而来
The EEC capital, all that foreign money pouring in.

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,172
他们本来就在中心位置
A sensible central location.

52
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,771
总部在布鲁塞尔 议会在斯特拉斯堡?
Administration in Brussels and Parliament in Strasbourg?

53
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:40,568
大臣 这就像把下院设在大西北
Minister! It's like having the Commons in Swindon

54
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,168
公务员放在中南部
the Civil Service in Kettering!

55
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,565
这么说 别的国家又图什么?     比如?
Why do other nations try to get in?

56
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,765
想想希腊
Take the Greeks...

57
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:55,044
我想不通希腊 尽管我对外国人一向很开明
Difficult to take the Greeks openminded as I am about foreigners

58
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:59,485
他们要什么? 橄榄山和松香酒湖
They'll want an olive mountain and a retsina lake.

59
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,452
我不信这些
I don't accept this!

60
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:05,847
对不起 大臣 您有些好朋友是希腊人?
I'm sorry. I suppose some of your best friends are Greeks?

61
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,494
很好笑
Very droll.

62
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,692
欧共体的问题不在国际合作 而在官僚主义
The problem isn't internationalism but too much bureaucracy.

63
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:15,211
可官僚主义正是国际合作的后果
The bureaucracy is a consequence of the internationalism.

64
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,969
不然为什么一名英国总长
Why else is there an English Commissioner,

65
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:23,926
下设一名法国主任 再往下又是一名意大利科长?
a French Director below him, an Italian Chef-du-Division?

66
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:27,167
我同意     这是巴别塔     我同意
It's like the Tower of Babel. I agree.

67
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,610
或者简直是联合国     我同意
Like the United Nations. I agree.

68
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,926
能插句嘴吗? 你们俩是不是彼此都同意?
If I may interject? You are in fact in agreement.

69
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,290
没那事
No, we're not.

70
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,212
典型欧共体官员什么样? 意大利人的组织能力
A Common Market official has the organising of the Italians,

71
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,288
德国人的弹性 法国人的谦逊
the flexibility of the Germans, the modesty of the French,

72
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:48,731
再加比利时人的想象力 荷兰人的慷慨
the imagination of the Belgians, the generosity of the Dutch

73
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,011
还有爱尔兰人的智力水平
and the intelligence of the Irish!

74
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:54,133
而且还是个保险箱     怎么讲?
It's all a gravy train! How do you mean?

75
00:04:54,295 --> 00:05:00,006
喝香槟 吃鱼子酱 公家豪华轿车 私人飞机
Live on champagne and caviar, Mercedes, private aeroplanes.

76
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,175
个个都伸嘴在食槽里拱
Every official has his snout in the trough

77
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,807
大多数人连前蹄也伸了进去
most of them their trotters as well!

78
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:11,925
抱歉我不同意 布鲁塞尔的人都是辛劳的公仆
Brussels is full of hard-working public servants

79
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:15,167
他们整日奔波 忍受无聊的招待
enduring exhausting travel and tedious entertainment.

80
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:19,851
是无聊哦 干掉那么多熏鲑鱼 灌进那么多香槟酒
Working their way through smoked salmon and all that champagne

81
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:26,123
大臣 反正错不在他们     怎么讲?
You're blaming the wrong people. What do you mean?

82
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:32,484
是您某位内阁同僚把团购计划捅到欧共体
One of your Cabinet colleagues warned Brussels of your plan

83
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:35,488
所以指令才来得这么快
which is why the directive appeared so quickly.

84
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:40,969
内阁同僚? 不用说 又是那个死科贝
Cabinet colleagues? Don't tell me! Bloody Corbett again!

85
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:45,965
每当想到科贝 我都替犹大喊冤
When I think of Corbett, I warm to Judas Iscariot!

86
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:51,446
对 确实是工商大臣捅的
Yes, it was the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

87
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:57,804
那个背信弃义 刚愎自用 好大喜功的小人
Treacherous, disloyal, arrogant publicity-seeking creep!

88
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,485
对不起 说得太难听了
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.

89
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,800
正相反 大臣
No, Minister

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,528
比起他常任秘书的评价 您这算赞歌了
Compared to what his Secretary says that's a generous tribute.

91
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,894
他怎么做到的?     谁知道?
How did he do it? Who knows?

92
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:11,773
晚报上有 大臣
The evening paper, Minister.

93
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,928
每当科贝靠近 我都觉得背后挨了一刀
Whenever Corbett comes near me I feel stabbing pains in the back

94
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,484
干吗给我这个 伯纳?
Why did you give me this, Bernard?

95
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,725
在这里     哦
Just there. Oh, yes.

96
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:24,126
天啊 内阁改组
Good God! Cabinet reshuffle!

97
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,968
"有消息称 首相将宣布内阁重大变动"
"It's rumoured that the PM will announce Cabinet changes

98
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,603
"就在本次会议期间"
"before the end of the present session."

99
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:36,368
我怎么不知道? 他们怎么知道? 真的假的?
Why didn't I know about this? How do they know? Is this true?

100
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:41,450
大臣 我只是一介公务员 不参与这种高层变动
I'm a humble civil servant, do not move in such exalted circles

101
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,890
不像内阁大臣和记者
as Cabinet Ministers and journalists.

102
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,364
确实是真的?     真的
But is it true? Yes.

103
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,491
你怎么知道 你不是不参与么?
How do you know?

104
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,885
我是说 真的有这个消息
I mean, it's true that it's rumoured.

105
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:57,531
内阁改组 我才刚开始着手我的...我们的...
Cabinet reshuffle I've hardly started the things that I...we...

106
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:00,448
也许不会动您 大臣
Perhaps you won't be moved, Minister.

107
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:05,131
不动的话 我的事业也就不会前进了
Ah... If I'm not, it means my career isn't moving forward

108
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:08,128
至少它不会倒退
At least it's not moving backwards.

109
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:12,766
倒退? 你不是说...天啊 可我...
Backwards? You don't mean...? Good God! But I...

110
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:18,214
该不会...会不会...我干的还不错吧?
It's not... I mean, it's... I've been doing all right, haven't I?

111
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,333
我们还不错吧?     您干的不错
We've done all right? You've done all right.

112
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,168
我们还不错吧 伯纳?     是 大臣
We've done all right? Yes, Minister.

113
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:29,363
就算我称不上功臣 可也不算失败
I may not be the outstanding success, but I'm not a failure.

114
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,404
大臣 您干的不错     其实我挺成功的
You've done all right. I've been quite successful.

115
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:40,164
如果马丁去财政部 我可能调去管外交部
If Martin were moved to Treasury, I could get Foreign Office!

116
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,567
可能吧
Perhaps you might.

117
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,044
你也拿不准啊     拿不准
You don't sound very certain. I'm not.

118
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:53,094
你有什么消息?     没消息 所以我才拿不准
What have you heard? Nothing, it's why I'm not certain.

119
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:57,407
卡弗怎么知道?     也许他说话首相听得入耳
Why does Bob Carver know? Perhaps he has the PM's ear.

120
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:01,966
首相把他揣在兜里     首相的耳朵还真长
He's in the PM's pocket. Then the PM must have a large ear.

121
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:08,164
好 这事咱们先不操心     好 大臣
Right, well... Let's not worry about it any more.

122
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:16,965
放下不谈了     是 大臣 我是说不谈了
We'll say no more about it. Yes, Minister. I mean, no, Minister.

123
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:20,127
急也是干着急 对吧?
There's no point worrying about it, is there?

124
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,849
根本就没什么可急的吧?     是 大臣
Nothing to worry about, is there? No, Minister.

125
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,485
好吧大臣 参加布鲁塞尔大会吗? 我觉得应该去
Shall we attend the Brussels conference? We should.

126
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,850
可如果首相要调动弗雷德...
But if the PM should move Fred...?

127
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,529
参不参加布鲁塞尔大会?
Shall we attend the conference in Brussels?

128
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:38,244
什么会?     文字处理设备
What? Word-processing.

129
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:42,772
哦 改组之前还是之后开?
Ah! Well, does it take place before or after the reshuffle?

130
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:47,725
谁知道?     算了 我听过这种事
Who can say? Well, no. I've known this happen before.

131
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,808
今天你不在其位 明天就不在位了
One day you're out of your office the next you're out of office.

132
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,170
这不是出国乱转的时候
This is no time for an idiotic foreign junket!

133
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:58,328
大臣 您不能为改组提心吊胆
Minister, you mustn't allow the reshuffle to prey on your mind.

134
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,725
我才没有提心吊胆
It's not preying on my mind.

135
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,693
我根本就不想它了     太好了
I'm not thinking any more about it. Splendid.

136
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:09,531
伯纳 6点来改组院...洗牌院...下院见我
Meet me at 6 o'clock in the House of shuffles...cards...Commons

137
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,448
晚上好 汉弗莱爵士     晚上好 少校
Good evening, Sir Humphrey. Good evening, Major.

138
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:24,404
阿诺德 改组的事几时能定?
Arnold, when will we know about the reshuffle?

139
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,486
还得等一阵
A little while yet.

140
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,771
我们部有什么消息吗?
Any news yet about my department?

141
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,646
得了 汉弗莱 我只是内阁秘书
I'm only Cabinet Secretary

142
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:34,646
又不是旗帜报政治通讯员
not political correspondent of the New Standard.

143
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,169
对我的大臣评价如何?
But how does my Minister stand?

144
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:41,452
首相似乎认为他干的不错
I think the PM feels he's done all right.

145
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:45,085
不过有个动向很有意思
But there's been an interesting development.

146
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,723
嗯?     嗯...
Mmm? Mmm.

147
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,445
啊
Aahh!

148
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:54,652
什么?
What?

149
00:09:55,975 --> 00:10:01,095
布鲁塞尔问他有没有空担任下届总长 只要他愿意
Brussels have asked if he'd be available for commissionership

150
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,564
他总归是亲欧洲派嘛
After all, he's a good European.

151
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,169
当然这都属于机密
In strict confidence, of course.

152
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,485
是要给他和平免职吗?
Is he being gently eased out?

153
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,566
汉弗莱爵士 阿诺德爵士
Sir Humphrey, Sir Arnold.

154
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,044
你来了 伯纳
There you are, Bernard.

155
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,968
好 喝杯咖啡如何 伯纳?
Right. Would you like a coffee, Bernard?

156
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,603
谢谢     一起坐坐 来杯咖啡
Thank you. Pull up a chair.

157
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:26,404
伯纳 换个大臣你觉得怎样?
Well, Bernard, how do you feel about having a new Minister?

158
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,772
你是说他...     不 汉弗莱爵士是在假设
You mean, he's... No, Sir Humphrey is conjecturing.

159
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,847
当然 我会很遗憾的
Ah, of course, I'd be very sorry.

160
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:38,409
怎么了 你不会吗?
Er... Why? Wouldn't you?

161
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,767
当然不会
Of course not!

162
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:43,608
可他开始拿得起工作了啊     正是
But he's getting a grip on the job. Exactly!

163
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,812
拿得起工作的大臣是祸害
Ministers with a grip on the job are a nuisance.

164
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,535
会提出争论     大臣都争论
They argue. All Ministers argue.

165
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:55,133
拿得起工作才危险 他们可能是对的
There's a real danger they'll be right.

166
00:10:56,575 --> 00:11:00,807
你告诉他们这事不可能 他们会挖出过去的报告
One tells them something is impossible, they dig out an old paper

167
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:04,206
里头你写着这事很好办 真无聊
in which one had said it was easy very tedious.

168
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,891
把他们送走 你就可以彻底清盘 从头调教新人
Once they've gone, one can start with a new boy.

169
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:12,889
改组真是一件盛事 首相也喜欢
Wonderful things, reshuffles. And Prime Ministers like them too.

170
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,411
干净利落 赶着大家团团转
Fresh, decisive, keeps everyone on the hop.

171
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,486
只有大臣们最慌张
Only Ministers panic about them.

172
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,969
有意思 能不能让大臣固定不动
Wouldn't it be interesting if Ministers were fixed

173
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:24,524
常任秘书改来改去?
and Permanent Secretaries were shuffled around.

174
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:34,768
那样的话 伯纳 会给整个体制致命一击
That, Bernard, would strike at the very heart of the system

175
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:38,211
直至动摇不列颠的国本
that has made Britain what she is today.

176
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,286
天长地久才是权力
Power goes with permanence.

177
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:44,243
变幻无常让人无力     轮流上台等于阉割
Impermanence is impotence. Rotation is castration.

178
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,406
是该让他们轮上一轮了
It's time they all had a little spin.

179
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,889
没错 可民主要求...
Yes, but surely in a democracy...

180
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:52,523
谢谢 伯纳 没你事了
Thank you, Bernard, that'll be all.

181
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,607
对 可我的...     谢谢 伯纳
Yes, but I've only... Thank you, Bernard.

182
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,970
好的 谢谢 汉弗莱爵士
Yes, thank you, Sir Humphrey.

183
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,603
晚安 阿诺德爵士
Good night, Sir Arnold.

184
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:11,095
如果你们大臣真去了布鲁塞尔 也别高兴得太早
If he does take Brussels, I wouldn't get out the champagne

185
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:16,885
怎么讲?      关于他的接班人有些风声
What do you mean? There is talk of his possible successor.

186
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,974
谁?
Who?

187
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:23,093
我不知该怎么告诉你 可是...
I don't know how to put this, but, well...

188
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,086
巴希尔·科贝
...Basil Corbett.

189
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:34,528
你怎么了 亲爱的? 吉姆?
What's the matter, darling? Jim?

190
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:37,931
吉姆     对不起
Jim! I'm sorry.

191
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,644
出什么事了?     没事
Something wrong? No, nothing, really.

192
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,612
肯定有事
Something is.

193
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:46,050
报纸上全是改组的消息
The papers are full of a reshuffle.

194
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,285
真的假的?     我不知道
Are they true? I don't know.

195
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:52,084
怎么 你在内阁啊     内阁总是最后知道
You're in the Cabinet. We're the last to find out.

196
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,644
不能问首相吗?     当然不能
Can't you ask the PM? Of course not.

197
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,251
怎么不能?     就是不能
Why not? Well... I just can't.

198
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:03,051
别人会以为我在发慌呢      这样啊
It would look as if I were insecure. I see.

199
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:07,572
不知是好事还是坏事 不知我要上还是要下
whether it's good or bad news, whether I'm up or down.

200
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:09,373
还是照例原地打转
Or round and round.

201
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,891
也不知我算成功还是失败
I don't know whether I'm a success or failure.

202
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:17,173
你觉得呢?     我觉得你干的不错
What do you think? I think you've done all right.

203
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,965
不错行吗?     我不知道 行吗?
Is that good enough? I don't know.

204
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,684
我不知道 行吗?     我不知道
I don't know, is it? I don't know.

205
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:27,894
说不准 也许首相嫌我太成功
The PM might think I've been too successful.

206
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,410
你知道 威胁到他的权威
You know, a challenge to the leadership.

207
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,167
你?
You?!

208
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:37,890
不是我 是马丁加上我的支持
No, not me, but Martin with my support.

209
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:41,127
你看 如果首相要铲除异己
If the PM is standing by to repel boarders,

210
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:44,093
又不能安稳地撵走马丁
and Martin can't be got rid of safely

211
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:48,248
外交大臣确实不好撵走 当然得拿我开刀了
as Foreign Secretary, I'm the obvious one for demotion.

212
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,293
孤立马丁     会送你去哪呢?
Isolate Martin. Where would you be sent?

213
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,015
挂名闲差多得是
There's no shortage of useless non-jobs.

214
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:58,248
枢密院长 掌玺大臣 体育部长
Lord President, Lord Privy Seal... Minister of Sport...

215
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,570
旱灾涝灾特派员
...with special responsibility for droughts and floods.

216
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,525
没准你会升职呢 亲爱的
Maybe you'll get promotion, darling.

217
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,687
也许吧 别忘了巴希尔·科贝
Maybe... Don't forget there's Basil Corbett.

218
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,733
他专门跟我过不去     他跟谁都过不去
He's out to get me. To get everyone.

219
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,808
他是个尖牙利齿死鱼眼 两面三刀的小人
He's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed, cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

220
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,205
他为什么这么吃香?
Why's he so successful?

221
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,366
因为他是个尖牙利齿死鱼眼
Because he's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed,

222
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,446
两面三刀的小人
cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

223
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:26,607
还有呢?     他电视形象不错
Apart from that? He looks OK on TV.

224
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,084
你也是啊     是吗?
So do you! Do I?

225
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,723
对     你说真的?
Yes! Really mean that?

226
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,853
对     你太好了
Yes. What a nice thing to say!

227
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,693
我和科贝彼此掣肘 挤来挤去
I've got to elbow Corbett or he'll elbow me.

228
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,813
手肘 政坛上最有力的武器
Elbows, the most important weapon in a politician's armoury.

229
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:47,129
除了正直之外     正直?
Other than integrity. Integrity?!

230
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,814
喂?
Yes?

231
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,604
哪位? 等等 是布鲁塞尔的加斯顿·拉罗
Who's speaking? Hold on. It's Gaston Larousse from Brussels.

232
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,766
布鲁塞尔?
From Brussels?

233
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,372
晚上好 专员(法语)...专员
Bonsoir, Commissionaire... Commissar...

234
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,294
对(意大利语)
Si...

235
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,891
非常有意思
That's very interesting.

236
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:17,286
请容我考虑一下
I shall need a little time to think about it.

237
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:19,605
我非常荣幸
I'm very honoured.

238
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:24,929
10号(意大利语)知道你在通知我吗?
Does Numero Dix know you're talking to me about this?

239
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,646
10号
Number 10.

240
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,370
唐宁街
Downing Street.

241
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:39,729
这样啊 那你给我留个家里电话
I see... Tell you what, give me your home telephone number.

242
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,253
好
Yes...

243
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:49,407
我会尽快答复你 非常感谢 再见
I'll give you a ring very soon. Thank you very much, goodbye.

244
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,531
什么事?
What was that?

245
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:55,050
我不知道     什么叫不知道?
I don't know. What do you mean?

246
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:02,288
他们要提名我担任英国驻欧共体专员
They want me as one of Britain's commissioners for the EEC.

247
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:08,851
什么意思?     搬家去布鲁塞尔呗
What does it mean? Living in Brussels.

248
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,128
不不 我是说 这是什么意思?
No, I mean, what does it mean?

249
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:16,527
10号知道了 那就是和平撤我职?
Number 10 knows, so is it a plot to ease me out?

250
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:20,893
是巧合? 是暗示? 究竟什么意思?
Is it just a coincidence? What does it mean? Is it a hint?

251
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:24,013
首相想让我光荣隐退?
Is the PM giving me a face-saving exit?

252
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:27,053
或者跟首相无关 本来就要派我去?
Or was the post coming up anyway?

253
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:30,571
某种方面说...是挺光荣的
It's a great honour... in a way.

254
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,613
这职位怎样?     惨透了
Is it a good job? Terrible.

255
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,205
跟英国政治完全隔绝
It's curtains as far as British politics is concerned.

256
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:43,845
比领爵位还惨 永世不得翻身
It's worse than a peerage. Absolute failure, total failure.

257
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:48,647
要想回来 除非自己建个党
You're reduced to forming a new party if you want to get back.

258
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,404
这工作具体干什么?
What does the job involve?

259
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:56,205
身处恐怖的欧共体官僚中心 进了保险箱
The heart of that ghastly Brussels bureaucracy, the gravy train.

260
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,084
每年薪水5万磅 报销2万磅
50,000 a year salary, 20,000 a year expenses.

261
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:04,774
香槟 龙虾 周游列国 高级酒店
Champagne, lobsters, foreign travel, luxury hotel...

262
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,731
豪华轿车 私人飞机
...private limousines, private aircraft...

263
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,810
午休时间
...siestas in the afternoon...

264
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,368
比利时海滩度周末
...long weekends at Knocke-le-Zoute...

265
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,328
我们去看看吧?      好啊
We should go over and have a look. Why not?

266
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:23,692
偶尔失败一下也不错
Sometimes we deserve a bit of failure.

267
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,450
内阁要改组 先生?
Going to be a reshuffle, sir?

268
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,925
对 从旗帜报上看来的吧
Yes, I suppose you saw that in the Standard.

269
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,973
对 先生     我也是
Yes, sir. So did I, actually.

270
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,774
当然 我几个星期前就听说了 先生
I first heard it a couple of weeks ago, sir.

271
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,891
是吗?     是 先生
Did you? Yes, sir.

272
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:44,570
其实我也是 听说什么?
So did I, really. Where did you hear it?

273
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,295
司机都知道了     怎么知道的?
All the drivers knew. How?

274
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,605
听首相的司机说的
From the PM's driver.

275
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,494
还有内阁秘书的司机     哦 对
The Cabinet Secretary's driver. Oh, yes.

276
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:57,091
还听说什么?     就是那些
What else did they hear? Just the usual.

277
00:17:57,255 --> 00:18:01,692
科贝要提拔了 首相不能再忽略他
Corbett's in line for promotion, PM can't overlook him.

278
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,485
显然 老弗雷德...抱歉 是就业大臣
Apparently, old Fred the Employment Secretary, sorry, sir -

279
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,249
他会被明升暗降 踢到上院去
he's going to get kicked upstairs.

280
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:12,930
他们怎么知道?     他换司机了
How do they know? His driver's been re-assigned.

281
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,731
关于我有什么消息?
What's the gossip about me?

282
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,363
还真没什么消息 先生
Well, nothing really, sir.

283
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,093
没有?     没有
Nothing? No.

284
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,815
我们都说不出个所以然来
We don't know what to make of that.

285
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:28,854
您有消息吧 先生?     我当然有
You'll know, won't you, sir? Yes, of course.

286
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,328
不过 当局者迷 旁观者清
Sometimes it's difficult to know about oneself.

287
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:35,885
就是 我到底有多成功...
You, know, just how successful...

288
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:41,969
你们圈子里...有没有...?
What do your mates say... about...?

289
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:46,333
都说您干的不错 先生
They all think you've done all right, sir.

290
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:52,371
伯纳 我有点进退两难     我能帮忙吗 大臣?
I'm in a bit of a quandary. Can I help, Minister?

291
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,413
内阁洗牌的事要下注了
It's this reshuffle that's on the cards.

292
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,049
非常巧妙 大臣
That's very witty, Minister!

293
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:05,973
对不起 我以为您在讲...请继续
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a... Do please carry on.

294
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:11,887
更麻烦的是 他们请我去做欧共体专员
To complicate matters, I've been asked to be an EEC Commissioner.

295
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:15,172
很好啊     好吗 伯纳? 这就是问题
Very nice. Is it nice, Bernard?

296
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:19,214
伯纳 你跟我说实话
Bernard, tell me, quite frankly...

297
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:25,364
我在这当大臣 是不是当的不错?
...as Minister here, do you think I've done all right?

298
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,206
是啊大臣 您确实不错
You've done all right.

299
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,054
你看 汉弗莱到处拦我的路
Humphrey's blocked me on so many issues.

300
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:34,490
从来没有诚心诚意站我这边
He's never really been on my side.

301
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:39,012
老实说 "不错"其实不算好吧?
To be honest, "all right" isn't really good enough, is it?

302
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:42,408
这个 它算...不错
Well, it's... all right.

303
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:50,965
你听到...什么小道消息吗?
Have you... er... heard anything... on the grapevine?

304
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,053
关于您?
About you?

305
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,206
没什么消息 大臣
Nothing really, Minister, no.

306
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,606
只说英国驻欧洲专员发了封电报
Only that the British Commissioner in Europe sent a telegram

307
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:01,653
给外交部和内阁欧洲委员会
to the FCO and the Cabinet Committee on Europe.

308
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:05,285
是布鲁塞尔提出请您做专员
The idea for you to be a Commissioner came from Brussels,

309
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,253
但终归得首相任命
but it is a Prime Ministerial appointment.

310
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,966
首相已经跟外交部长和内阁秘书谈过
The PM discussed it with Foreign Secretary and Cabinet Secretary

311
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:16,332
并且同意他们探探您的口风
and cleared the way for you to be sounded out.

312
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:20,329
首相府和财政部都相信您会接受
As it's believed at Number 10 and Number 11 that you might accept

313
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:24,488
还问了内阁里的某人愿不愿接您的班
a colleague has been sounded out about becoming Minister here.

314
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,930
恐怕我知道的就这些
I'm afraid that's all I know.

315
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,485
没别的了?
No more than that?

316
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,005
问谁愿不愿接我的班?
Which colleague has been sounded out to take my place?

317
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:43,444
伯纳 如果我不去欧洲...
Bernard, if I were not to go to Europe...

318
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:48,484
不 如果我去...不 如果我不去
No, if I did go... No, if I were not to go to Europe,

319
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:52,568
我会升还是降?
would I go up or down?

320
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,813
汉弗莱爵士要来开会了 大臣
Time for your meeting with Sir Humphrey, Minister.

321
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,694
喂 好的     什么事?
Yes, fine. What's it about?

322
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,972
去不去文字处理设备大会的事
The visit to the word-processing conference.

323
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,490
文字处理设备大会?
The word-processing conference?

324
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:13,126
汉弗莱 告诉你个好消息 我改主意了
Humphrey, you'll be pleased to hear that I've changed my mind,

325
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:16,173
我确实应该去布鲁塞尔
I shall be going to Brussels after all.

326
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:19,691
您要辞掉行政部的职位?
You're resigning from the Department?!

327
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:23,165
不不不 我要参加文字处理设备大会
No, I'm talking about this word-processing conference.

328
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:26,611
这样啊     我还是想去布鲁塞尔转转
I see. I would like to see Brussels.

329
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,084
理由呢?     没理由不去
Why? Why not?

330
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,769
是没理由不去 可理由呢?
Why not, indeed, but why?

331
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:35,211
我好奇嘛     您是挺好奇的 大臣
I'm a curious person. You certainly are.

332
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,605
我昨天言重了
I've been a little hasty.

333
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,847
你对布鲁塞尔的辩护很有说服力
Your arguments on behalf of Brussels were thoroughly convincing.

334
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:44,291
大臣 我又回味了一下您的观点
Minister, I've been reflecting on your views,

335
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:47,492
您对布鲁塞尔的批评非常明智
and I find wisdom in your criticism of Brussels.

336
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:52,046
您暗示的腐败和...     不不不
You implied it is corrupt and... No, no, no.

337
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:54,410
大臣 求您...     不对 汉弗莱
Minister, please... No, Humphrey.

338
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:57,009
是你说服了我
It is you who have convinced me.

339
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:01,327
我现在相信 布鲁塞尔都是敬业的官员
I'm now convinced that Brussels is full of dedicated men,

340
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:05,966
肩负着四处奔波 公关接待的重担
all bearing a heavy burden of travel and entertainment.

341
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:08,330
奢侈是工作需要
They need all that luxury.

342
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,451
喝喝小酒
The odd drinky!

343
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:14,132
鱼子酱 香槟 私人飞机 豪华轿车?
Caviar and champagne, private planes, air-conditioned Mercedes?

344
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,286
这是外交的润滑油
It oils the diplomatic wheels.

345
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,291
伸嘴拱食?
Snouts in the trough.

346
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:24,529
别说的这么难听     对不起 真不知我跟谁学的
That's not an attractive phrase I can't think where I picked it up

347
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:28,085
我们都去布鲁塞尔开会 说定了?
We'll all go to this conference, agreed?

348
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:33,090
大臣 您改主意完全因为我的话?     当然是
Is your change of heart due to my arguments? Of course.

349
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:38,045
不是因为传说中布鲁塞尔专员的职位?
It's nothing to do with the rumour of your post in Brussels?

350
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,530
汉弗莱 你怎么能这么想
That thought is not worthy of you.

351
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,812
世上还有正直这回事
There is such a thing as integrity.

352
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,771
好的 谢谢
Oh, yes, thank you.

353
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,004
科贝 你不能让科贝这种人...
Corbett! You can't let someone like Corbett...

354
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,811
不能让科贝这种人管我们部
You simply can't let Corbett loose on the department.

355
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:08,251
这是灭顶之灾 不管你跟他说什么
It'd be disastrous. Everything one says to Corbett

356
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:10,929
明天一早准上太阳报
appears in the Sun the next morning.

357
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:14,206
很高兴你还读太阳报 (煽情小报 三版有裸女)
Glad to know you read the Sun.

358
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:18,813
你一定要制止 阿诺德 我求你
You must stop it, Arnold, I implore you.

359
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,931
我又不是首相
I'm not the Prime Minister.

360
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,609
可实际控制改组的是你吧
It is really you who arranges the reshuffles.

361
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:27,484
不 如果首相真决定任命谁
No, if there's an appointment the PM is set on,

362
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:30,215
内阁秘书只能勉为其难地照办
the Cabinet Secretary must reluctantly acquiesce.

363
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:33,694
大方向上是你掌舵吧
You do keep your hand on the tiller.

364
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,733
如果哈克拒绝欧共体职位
If Hacker decides to turn down Brussels,

365
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:41,524
科贝就不那么容易去你们部
it would be easier to keep Corbett away from your department.

366
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:44,448
问题就在这里 他打算接受欧共体职位
This is the trouble, he'll take Brussels.

367
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:47,611
哦     是啊 我知道
Oh. Yes, I know.

368
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,892
他说他相信大欧洲理念
He says he believes in the European ideal.

369
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,444
对 我知道 我知道
Yes, I know, I know.

370
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:58,210
政客职业病嘛 会上自己的当
Politicians get taken in by their own speeches.

371
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:04,570
你也有错 汉弗莱 你三天两头泼他冷水
This is partly your fault. You've blocked Hacker time and again.

372
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:08,968
都是为了政府好 阿诺德
Only in the interests of good government, Arnold.

373
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:14,209
那当然 不过你最好让他这两天出点成就
Quite. But what you need is a big success in the next few days.

374
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,935
出点成就?     对
A big success? Yes.

375
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,325
就这两天?
The next few days?

376
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:25,211
这样我...首相就有充分理由留下他
That would give me, give the PM a good case for keeping him here.

377
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,129
然后 就好把科贝调到就业部去了
Then, we might be able to move Corbett to Employment.

378
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,771
弗雷德非撤不可吗?
Is Fred definitely going?

379
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,574
对 他老在内阁会议上打瞌睡
Yes, he keeps falling asleep in Cabinet.

380
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:38,171
我以为他们都打瞌睡
I thought they all did.

381
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,293
对 不过总不至于在说话的时候
Yes, but not while they're actually talking.

382
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:56,172
汉弗莱 有消息吗?     什么消息 大臣?
Ah, Humphrey! Any news? Of what, Minister?

383
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:58,326
当然是内阁改组     没有
The Cabinet reshuffle. No.

384
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:01,089
你中午不是和内阁秘书吃饭了吗?
Didn't you have lunch with the Cabinet Secretary?

385
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,166
对     有什么结论?
Yes. What came up?

386
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,927
眼下没结论
Nothing as yet!

387
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:09,088
我只知道改组的事周一公布
All I know is the reshuffle will be announced on Monday.

388
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:11,815
您有消息吗?     什么消息?
Have you any news? Of what?

389
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,610
专员的事 您去不去布鲁塞尔?
The Commissionship. Are you going to Brussels?

390
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,326
这个...
Well...

391
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:22,615
作为议员来说 我觉得不该去
With my Parliamentary hat, I don't think it would be a good idea.

392
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:27,053
不过作为内阁大臣 我觉得应该去
With my Cabinet hat on, it would be a good idea.

393
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:31,766
而作为党派成员 该去也不该去
With my party hat on, there could be arguments on both sides.

394
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:34,768
懂了 您到底把自个当什么?
Which hat are you talking through now?

395
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:41,333
您决定要去布鲁塞尔了?     是也不是
Have you decided about going to Brussels? Yes and no.

396
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:47,172
您在犹豫什么呢 大臣?      我不知道
What are the pros and cons, Minister? I don't know.

397
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,528
我以前可能没说过
I haven't said this before,

398
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:57,644
但这取决于我是不是还不错 你们说呢?
but it depends on whether I've done all right. What do you think?

399
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,806
您确实不错
You've done all right.

400
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,648
如果我真的不错 那就错不了
If I've done all right, that's all right,

401
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:05,090
我得留下 结果应该还不错
I shall stay because I'll be all right.

402
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:09,373
可如果我只是不错 留下就错了 没错吧?
But if I've only done all right, to stay would be wrong, right?

403
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,535
大臣 我有个建议
Minister, I have a suggestion

404
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,404
为稳妥起见 您得做出点成就
to be on the safe side, you need a big success.

405
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,805
可不是     大获全胜那种     对
Yes. A triumph, in fact.

406
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,127
得提升个人形象 做出一大政绩
You need some publicity for a great political achievement.

407
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:25,288
对对 你有什么主意?     我不知道 我正在想
What have you in mind? I'm trying to think of something.

408
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,731
多谢你 帮大忙了 干吗突然要政绩?
Thank you, that's a great help. What's the purpose?

409
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:30,851
午餐时确实有些结论
Something did come up at lunch.

410
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,290
阿诺德爵士说有了这么个胜利
Sir Arnold feels that with this triumph,

411
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,571
首相就不好给您降职
the PM couldn't move you downwards,

412
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:39,853
伯纳和我就有幸能把您留在身边
Bernard and I have the good fortune of you staying on with us.

413
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,085
不可能给我升职吗?
So there's no chance of moving up?

414
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,530
哦...
Ooh...

415
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:46,890
可惜啊 大臣 没有
Sadly, Minister, alas.

416
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,933
人还是现实点好     好吧
One must be a realist. Oh, well.

417
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,369
就这么办 我得去布鲁塞尔了
That's it, it's got to be Brussels.

418
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:56,925
且慢 我想到了
No, wait a minute. I've got an idea.

419
00:26:57,095 --> 00:27:00,292
如果您不搭理欧共体

420
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:03,413
照样发表您的设备团购计划
Publish your own plans for word-processing machines...

421
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,487
给英国厂家下大笔订单

00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,451
我们不能挑战欧共体指令     其实不是指令
We can't defy an EEC directive. It isn't a directive.

428
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:27,766
还没正式签发 目前只是请求
It hasn't been ratified, it's merely a request.

429
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:31,007
我们不能对欧洲友邦背后捅刀子 当面吐口水
We can't stab our partners in the back and spit in their face.

430
00:27:31,175 --> 00:27:35,134
您对谁也不能背后捅刀子又当面吐口水
You can't stab anyone in the back while spitting in their face.

431
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:38,529
话说回来 挑战布鲁塞尔就会...
On the other hand, defying Brussels would be...

432
00:27:38,695 --> 00:27:40,208
大受欢迎
Very popular!

433
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,605
还证明我能够掣肘他
And prove I had elbows.

434
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:44,768
什么?
What?

435
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:47,290
手肘 手肘
Elbows, elbows!

436
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,013
可是     可是什么 大臣?
But... But what?

437
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,609
我就得放弃那些...
I'd have to give up all that...

438
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,448
食槽     对
Trough. Right.

439
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:58,927
事到临头 人总得以本国为重
When it comes down to it, one's own country must come first.

440
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:01,373
太对了
How true.

441
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:05,050
尽管严格说来 这不算政府事务 大臣
And, although, strictly, this isn't a Government matter,

442
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:08,890
您走了我个人也会痛惜之至
I, personally, would be deeply sorry to lose you.

443
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,444
是吗 汉弗莱 你说真的?
Really, Humphrey, is that true?

444
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,004
千真万确 大臣 绝对是肺腑之言
Yes, I mean that, Minister, most sincerely.

445
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:18,009
你太好了 汉弗莱 我们彼此是有些好感
I suppose we have got fond of one another.

446
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,689
某些方面      某些方面 对
In a way. In a way, yes.

447
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,210
就像恐怖分子和他的人质
Like a terrorist and his hostage.

448
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,613
你们俩谁是恐怖分子?
Which is the terrorist?

449
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,731
他是
He is!

450
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,327
好的 伯纳 就这么定了
Right, OK, Bernard, that's the decision.

451
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,451
通知媒体好吗?     是 大臣
Inform the press!

452
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:41,973
告诉我 汉弗莱 如果我走了谁会接班?
Tell me, Humphrey, who would have got my position?

453
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,812
我不知道
I don't know...

454
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,206
您不是说是巴希尔·科贝吗?
Didn't you tell me it was Basil Corbett?

455
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,451
巴希尔·科贝?
Basil Corbett?!

456
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:54,775
原来如此 巴希尔·科贝
I see, Basil Corbett.

457
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:00,887
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
