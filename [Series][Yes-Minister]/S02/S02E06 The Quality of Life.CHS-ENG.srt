生活质量
The Quality of Life

5
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,749
他还在跟宣传秘书开会 汉弗莱爵士
He's still with the Press Officer, Sir Humphrey.

6
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,422
您先喝杯咖啡?
Would you like a coffee?

7
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:52,501
伯纳 如果大臣和宣传秘书在一起
If the Minister is with the Press Officer,

8
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,467
我们吃顿大餐也有时间
we've probably got time for a six-course lunch.

9
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,865
早 戴斯蒙爵士      早 汉弗莱      哦 戴斯蒙
Morning, Humphrey. Desmond!

10
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:04,624
他在开会 用不了多久的
He's got somebody with him, but he'll only be a moment.

11
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,101
你试过他口风了?     试了 恐怕目前希望不大
Did you sound him out about...? Yes, but it doesn't look hopeful.

12
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,782
为什么 我们银行只不过想
All my bank wants is to put six

13
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:15,943
在新办公楼上加盖6层而已 没问题嘛
little storeys on the new office block.

14
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,942
你读今早的金融时报了吗?     我从来不读
Read the Financial Times today? Never do!

15
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,748
你是银行家嘛 当然要读金融时报
You're a banker, surely you read the Financial Times?

16
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,425
看也看不懂 全是经济理论
Can't understand it. Full of economic theory.

17
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:30,899
那你买它干吗?     唉 专业形象的一部分嘛
Why do you buy it? It's part of the uniform.

18
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,907
我花了30年才搞懂凯恩斯理论
Took me 30 years to understand Keynes' economics.

19
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,460
刚摸着门 大家又去追捧新货币理论了
I'd just cottoned when everyone got hooked on monetarist ideas

20
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,065
你知道 米尔顿·舒曼说的"我要自由市场"
you know, "I Want To Be Free", by Milton Shulman.

21
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,381
米尔顿·弗里德曼?     干嘛都叫米尔顿?
Milton Friedman? Why are they all called Milton?

22
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,063
我就知道米尔顿·凯恩斯
I've only got as far as Milton Keynes.

23
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,545
梅纳德·凯恩斯?
Maynard Keynes?

24
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,018
肯定有个米尔顿·凯恩斯
I'm sure there's a Milton Keynes.

25
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,626
对对 是有一个
Yes, there is, it's...

26
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,381
请坐
Sit down.

27
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,539
你还没看过大臣昨晚
You didn't read about the Minister's speech

28
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,984
致建筑业协会的讲话吧?
to the Architectural Association last night,

29
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,107
抨击了摩天大楼群 媒体反响很好
attacking skyscraper office blocks?

30
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,702
我们那幢可不是摩天大楼
Ours isn't a skyscraper.

31
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,224
有几层来着?     38层
How many storeys? 38.

32
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:18,506
再加这6层 就是44层
44 with the extra six we're asking for.

33
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,541
可他说最高不许超过8层
He was talking about the maximum tolerable height being eight.

34
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,826
得了小汉 你肯定能劝服他吧?
Surely you can talk him out of it?

35
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,982
一点点往上加 8 12 18...
Work him upwards? 8, 12, 18...

36
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:33,265
你不就干这个嘛 劝他放弃政策
That's your job talking him out of things.

37
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,139
对 可别忘了他承诺过
Don't forget, there's a promise

38
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:38,139
限制高层建筑
to prevent any more high-rise buildings

39
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,743
写在他竞选宣言的环境部分
in the environment section of the manifesto.

40
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,060
那就没戏啦?    也不一定
Does that scupper it? Not necessarily.

41
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:47,266
你看 每位大臣的高级公务员
There's an implicit pact offered to every Minister

42
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:51,502
都会向其暗示一笔交易
by his senior officials.

43
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,548
如果大臣帮我们实施的政策
If the Minister implements the opposite

44
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,382
与他的承诺截然相反
policy to the one he's pledged to,

45
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,585
一旦上任 他必然发现宣言不可行
which, once in office, he will see is incorrect,

46
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:02,708
我们就帮他掩饰 假装他遵守了承诺
we'll help him to pretend he's following his manifesto.

47
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,185
这交易挺合理的     听上去确实合理
That's a very reasonable offer. It sounds reasonable.

48
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,547
不幸的是 戴斯蒙 政客们尽管有很多
Unfortunately, among the many

49
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,461
卓越的特质
extraordinary qualities politicians possess,

50
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,781
讲理却不怎么被他们看重
reasonableness isn't the first that springs to mind.

51
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,946
至少一般大臣都是如此
Not when one contemplates the average Minister.

52
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,464
而我们的大臣非常一般
And our Minister is very average.

53
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,619
但是我们确实需要加盖几层
But we need those extra floors.

54
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,781
而且如果你退休后加入董事会
And if you're joining the board when you retire,

55
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,907
没有办公室就麻烦了
it'll be tricky if there's no office to put you in.

56
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,345
在停车场上搭个活动会客室?
Entertaining your visitors in a Portakabin in the car park?

57
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,000
我又没说不批给你
I'm not saying you won't get permission

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,660
只是今天不行 耐心点
just not today. Be patient.

59
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,980
只要大臣拍个板不就完了吗?
Surely if a Minister's made a decision, that's it?

60
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:52,540
你怎能这么想?     他决定的就是决议呗
What gave you that idea? Surely a decision's a decision?

61
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,303
我们满意的才是决议
Only if it's the decision you want.

62
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:59,540
要不然 只是一时挫折而已
If not, it's just a temporary setback.

63
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,064
大臣都像小孩子 容易冲动
Ministers are like small children:

64
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,267
今天吵着要什么东西
They want something desperately

65
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,467
明天就忘得一干二净
and next day forget they asked for it.

66
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,623
大臣不是效忠皇冠吗?    你当这雅号怎么来的?
He is a Minister of the Crown. You know why he's called that?

67
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,065
他说话一般不过大脑
He's always talking off the top of his head...

68
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,060
或者说完就抛到脑后
or through the back of it!

69
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,188
你要反对他的决定?     不不不
You won't accept his decision? No, no, no.

70
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,864
我要从热烈欢迎 坚决支持开始
I start by accepting it and supporting it enthusiastically,

71
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,378
然后请他交给我完成
then I tell him to leave it to me.

72
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,306
汉弗莱 搞建筑的来了
Humphrey, the architect fellow.

73
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,381
早上好 克劳福 请坐 大臣还得一会儿
Morning, Crawford. The Minister won't keep a moment.

74
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,380
那得怎么办?
So, what's going to happen?

75
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,219
我先跟他谈谈
I'll have a minute with him first,

76
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,983
但今天上午别指望太多
but don't expect too much this morning.

77
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,740
就当成小孩子为米饭布丁闹腾吧
Think of it as a child's tantrum over a rice pudding.

78
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,219
今天碰也不碰 明天就要两份
Won't touch it today and yet wants two helpings tomorrow.

79
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,459
啊 米饭布丁 好啊
Ah, rice pudding... good.

80
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:56,225
其实我也满喜欢米饭布丁的
I always liked rice pudding.

81
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,746
大臣 这真是太棒了
Minister, it's really excellent.

82
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,628
"哈克大声疾呼 反对高层建筑"      是不错
"Hacker speaks out against tower blocks."

83
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:05,223
"大臣咬定摩天大楼不松口"
"Minister's courageous stand on high buildings."

84
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,226
难道我是蜘蛛人么
I sound like a steeplejack.

85
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,300
这是高端的 大众媒体呢?
What about the popular press?

86
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:12,620
坊间那些日报是怎么说我的?
How do I get into the mass circulation dailies?

87
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:17,465
有照片吗?     报纸一般爱登漂亮姑娘的照片
What about a photograph? The papers like photos of a pretty girl

88
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,984
这个标准 我算够不上了
I don't quite qualify on that score.

89
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,000
不 我是说 您可以去选美比赛当评委
Judge a beauty contest

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,548
亲吻冠军 这就上报了
a photo of you kissing the winner.

91
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,462
太俗了吧 再说要是登我的照片
If my picture's in the papers,

92
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,666
人们应该关注我 而不是美女
people should look at me, not some pretty girl.

93
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,741
不然跟小动物或小孩拍照也行
Otherwise, something with cuddly animals or small children,

94
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,423
比如今天下午访问城市农场
like this afternoon's visit to the city farm.

95
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:40,228
对对 都刊登了吗? 邮报 镜报 每日快报
Is everything laid on Mail, Mirror, Express?

96
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,461
还有太阳报 今日头条 晚间新闻     晚间新闻?
And the Sun, Today and Nationwide. Nationwide?

97
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,462
我会上电视吗?     走运的话
Will I be on telly? With any luck.

98
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,304
好 这还差不多     先生 您是效忠皇冠的嘛
Well done! You are a Minister of the Crown, sir.

99
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,218
您还得和一群小驴子合个影
There's some baby donkeys laid on to be photographed with.

100
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,740
驴子?     是的 先生
Donkeys? Yes, sir.

101
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:59,981
太阳报特别询问
The Sun specifically asked

102
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:03,425
您能否站在驴子中间拍照
if you could be photographed amongst the donkeys.

103
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,661
驴子啊 你说呢 伯纳?
What do you think, Bernard?

104
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,000
即使太阳报动机纯良
Even if the Sun has no ulterior motive

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,380
侦探报也会大做文章
it'll be a gift for Private Eye.

106
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,180
"您和其他驴子"
You with a crowd of other donkeys.

107
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,986
是他们会这么说 大臣 或者"核心内阁会议"
That's what they would say. Or a meeting of the Inner Cabinet.

108
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,538
你来干嘛 伯纳?
What are you here for, Bernard?

109
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,503
对 汉弗莱爵士来了     好吧
Sir Humphrey's here. Very well.

110
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,819
农场肯定还有小猪吧
There's also some little pigs.

111
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:34,026
我看小猪也强不到哪去
I don't think that's a great improvement. 95()

112
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,060
想想"猪嘴刨食"(以权谋私)的笑话 用用脑子
Snouts in the trough jokes pull yourself together!

113
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:41,744
可是大臣      我最多和羊羔拍个照 最多了
I will consent to be photographed with a lamb, that's all.

114
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,059
啊 汉弗莱     早上好
Ah, Humphrey. Good morning.

115
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,663
大臣 戴斯蒙·格雷布克爵士来了
Sir Desmond Glazebrook is outside.

116
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,105
格雷布克? 那个老嚷嚷反政府的笨蛋?
Glazebrook? That old fool who makes anti-Government speeches?

117
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,800
就是他 您任命他为
Yes, and you appointed him

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,818
工业合作主席
chairman of the co-partnership commission.

119
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,187
是哦 他有何贵干?
What's he want?

120
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,466
他找您谈一个申请
He wants to talk about his forthcoming application

121
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,587
给他在建的银行大厦多批几层楼
to put more storeys on his bank's office block.

122
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:05,900
当前要打击的正是这个 汉弗莱
That's just the thing we must stop, Humphrey.

123
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,947
得有人为环境登高一呼
Somebody has to speak out about the environment,

124
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,020
在摩天大楼上勇敢站出来
take a stand on high buildings.

125
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,544
这造型拍下来登报挺好
That would make a good press photograph.

126
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,141
谢谢 伯纳
Thank you, Bernard.

127
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,381
听您的 大臣 不过他的项目不错
It's up to you, but he does have a good case.

128
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:22,188
您读了背景资料吗?
Have you read the background papers?

129
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,704
当然读了 提醒我一下
Yes, of course. Remind me.

130
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,743
银行指出
The bank points out that

131
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:31,185
附近已经有几幢摩天大楼
there are already several tower blocks nearby,

132
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,100
这次是为了银行国际部
and it is the international division of the bank

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,944
迅速扩张
expanding rapidly.

134
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,662
银行得建在市中心
It needs a central location.

135
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:39,062
会大幅增加城市税收
It would bring in revenue for the city.

136
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,983
可不是 钱钱钱 美观呢 汉弗莱?
Typical! Money, money, money. What about beauty, Humphrey?

137
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,504
确实啊 大臣 美观
Indeed, Minister, beauty.

138
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,745
拿笔记下来 伯纳
Make a note of that, Bernard.

139
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,377
我们的孩子呢 子孙后代呢?
What about our children? And their children?

140
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:53,109
确实 大臣 "子孙后代" 伯纳
Exactly, Minister, "Children's children", Bernard.

141
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:56,466
汉弗莱 你到底侍奉上帝还是财神?
Who are you serving? God or Mammon?

142
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,824
我侍奉您 大臣
I'm serving you, Minister.

143
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:01,787
既然如此 汉弗莱 请戴斯蒙爵士进来
In that case, Humphrey, show Sir Desmond in.

144
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,264
格雷布克 我让你盖...
Glazebrook! I'll give him high-rise buildings...

145
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,626
戴斯蒙爵士 幸会幸会 有什么可以效劳吗?
Sir Desmond, how nice to see you! What can I do for you?

146
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,383
就盖几层楼的事儿 加盖6层
It's these extra storeys, six of them.

147
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,200
正式申请随后递交
We'll make a formal application later

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,861
在此之前 您有什么指点吗?
but any guidance you can give us...?

149
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,544
话说在前头 我一向反对高层建筑
I warn you that I have misgivings about tower blocks.

150
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,702
不然怎么赚钱啊 多造6层才能大翻身
This is how we make profits. Six extra storeys and we clean up.

151
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:31,100
不然这个项目只有可怜的28%的赚头
Without them, we'll only make a measly 28% on the project.

152
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,057
懂了 净讲利润是不是     不是净利润 是毛利
It's just profits, is it? Not "Just profits", it's profits!

153
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,938
除了钱你就不想点别的?     不想 怎么?
Don't you think of anything but money? No, why?

154
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,944
美观怎么说呢?     美观?这是幢楼 不是幅画
What about beauty? It's a building, not an oil painting.

155
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,588
环境问题呢?
And the environment?

156
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:48,219
对 我保证让大楼融入环境
We'll make sure it's part of the environment.

157
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:51,586
都杵在那了 想不融入也难
It's bound to be, once it's there.

158
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,104
抱歉 戴斯蒙爵士     还有一件事 大臣
I'm sorry, Sir Desmond... There's one thing, Minister.

159
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,144
报上说 政府发过这种批文
As you know, similar permission was given

160
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:01,144
给纽约大通银行
to Chartered of New York,

161
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,459
要是拒绝英国银行...
so to refuse a British bank...

162
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,859
就是 没问题了吧?
Exactly! So it's all right?

163
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,941
呃..不 不行
Er... well... no. No, it isn't.

164
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:13,387
他妈的 怎么不行?    并...并不一定...
Why not, damn it? It-it-it's not necessarily...

165
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,145
大臣是担心一幢新楼
The Minister is concerned that another tall building

166
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:18,145
会破坏已有的天际线
will clutter the skyline.

167
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:20,539
对 破坏天际线
That's right, it would clutter the skyline.

168
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,985
也很担心 项目所需的大批工人
He's also worried that more workers in the area

169
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,617
会拖累城市交通系统
would strain the transport system.

170
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,905
我很担心交通系统
I'm worried about public transport.

171
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,981
而且 他还指出高楼会挡住
Furthermore, he points out that it will overshadow

172
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,539
附近小学操场的阳光      没错
the playground of the St Joseph's Primary School.

173
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,000
大楼上可以俯瞰私家花园
It would overlook private gardens

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,861
从而侵犯了个人隐私
which would be an intrusion of privacy.

175
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,338
隐私 污染
Privacy! Pollution!

176
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,702
另外他还指出 一针见血啊大臣
Furthermore, the Minister points out, most astutely

177
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:51,305
贵行在不远处还有块空地
that the bank owns a vacant site close by

178
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,858
正好能解决你们扩张的需求
which would accommodate your expansion needs.

179
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,860
哪里?     那里
Where? There.

180
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,419
那不是河吗?
That's the river, isn't it?

181
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:02,062
大臣指的是这块地
The Minister was referring to this site.

182
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,707
是我们的吗?     是的 戴斯蒙爵士
Is that ours? It is, Sir Desmond.

183
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,542
干什么用的?     计划用于三期工程
What's it for? It's scheduled for phase three.

184
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:12,827
那是三期工程用的 再说它在400码以外呢
That's scheduled for phase three. it's 400 yards away.

185
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:16,379
董事们没法跑到400码之外去吃午饭
Difficult for the board to walk 400 yards to lunch...

186
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,461
吃完就更走不回来了
...and impossible to walk back afterwards.

187
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:24,062
戴斯蒙爵士 正式申请你们爱交就交
Put in your formal application by all means,

188
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:26,185
不过我决心已定
but that will be my decision.

189
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:30,585
大臣 要是我们设计一种新的米饭布丁呢?
Minister, suppose we designed a different rice pudding?

190
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,462
什么?     什么?
What? What?

191
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:35,857
米饭布丁?
Rice pudding?

192
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,227
对 银行家管高楼叫米饭布丁 大臣
Bankers' jargon for high-rise buildings.

193
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,426
是吗?
Is it?

194
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,106
伯纳 请送送戴斯蒙爵士
Bernard, show Sir Desmond out.

195
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,100
再会 戴斯蒙爵士
Bye, Sir Desmond.

196
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,066
哦 好的
Oh, yes. Right.

197
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:56,986
多谢你 汉弗莱 你那些提醒太及时了
Thank you, your reminders were very helpful.

198
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,663
我很荣幸 大臣     我们真是绝配啊
A pleasure. Real teamwork, what?

199
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,547
而且格雷布克还是你熟人
Especially as Glazebrook is your chum.

200
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,947
对 我们是老朋友了 大臣
We're very old friends.

201
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:07,000
不过至交好友又怎能比得上
But it is as naught compared to

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,785
公务员对大臣的忠诚?
a civil servant's duty to his Minister.

203
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,781
汉弗莱 你说真的吗?     当然是真的 大臣
Humphrey, do you mean that? Of course, Minister!

204
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,178
你太好了     谢谢夸奖
How very nice. Thank you.

205
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,026
半点了 大臣     我得赶快了
It's after half past. I've got to dash.

206
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,858
紧急任务?   非常紧急
Urgent appointment? Very urgent.

207
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,499
内阁委员会?     对...不是 差不多的
Cabinet committee? That sort of thing.

208
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,742
您能签了这个吗 大臣? 非常重要
Could you sign this? It's extremely urgent.

209
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,865
非签不可吗? 我已经晚了
Do I have to? I'm late already.

210
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,022
对 可这是行政命令      干什么的?
It's an administrative order to formalise Government powers

211
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,783
该命令正式授权政府
for the utilisation of unused local authority land

212
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:39,783
利用地方上的未规划土地
until development commences,

213
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,385
当然 规划后再交还地方
then it reverts to the authority.

214
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,859
非得现在签吗? 怎么没提交下院?      十万火急
Do I have to sign now? Why hasn't it been before the House?

215
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,019
当然 如果是法规
If it were a statutory instrument

216
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,019
就要下院审核
it would have to go before the House,

217
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:54,419
可这是行政命令
but it's an administrative order,

218
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,581
根据环境法案第7条第3款
under section seven of the Environment Act,

219
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,865
就是管辖权条款
which is an enabling section,

220
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,260
规定大臣有权出台政策
empowering the Minister to make regulations

221
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,200
对地方上未开垦土地
regarding unused local authority land

222
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,945
随时进行适当调整
as necessary from time to time

223
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:11,863
只要在该法案框架内 您当然记得的
within the framework of the Act, as I'm sure you recollect.

224
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,623
为什么没提交下院?
Why doesn't it go before the House?

225
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,505
我说了 如果是法规
If it were a statutory instrument

226
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,505
就要下院审核
it would have to go before the House,

227
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,264
但这是行政命令
but because it is an administrative order

228
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,264
根据环境法案第7条第3款...
under section seven of the...

229
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:27,068
好好汉弗莱 我签完了 快点伯纳     谢谢 大臣
All right, Humphrey, I have signed it!

230
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,706
这个为什么这么急?
Why was that so urgent?

231
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,702
其实并不急     您刚才说很急
It wasn't. But you said it was.

232
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:38,064
不是很急 但是非常重要
It wasn't urgent, but it was important.

233
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:39,787
任何将大臣的决策权
Any document transferring decision-making power

234
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,543
转移给我们的文件都很重要
from Ministers to us is important.

235
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,507
为什么?     哦 伯纳
Why? Oh, Bernard...!

236
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:48,422
拜托你别呆头呆脑的行不行
Don't be obtuse, please.

237
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,108
这是从政治中解救政府之道
It helps take Government out of politics.

238
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,944
惟其如此 英国才能长存
It's Britain's only chance of survival.

239
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,385
就不能等他不急的时候吗?
Couldn't it have waited until he wasn't in a hurry?

240
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:02,667
伯纳 要让大臣不问缘由直接签字
When we want Ministers to sign without asking questions

241
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,664
就得挑他们慌慌张张的时候
we wait until they're in a hurry

242
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:07,664
注意力最薄弱
and their concentration is weakest.

243
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,667
容易得手 所以要让他们忙着
That's why we keep them on the go.

244
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,545
伯纳 大臣这么匆忙是要去什么神秘地点呀?
Bernard, where was the Minister rushing off to so secretively?

245
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,303
访问塔区的一个小学生农场
A school children's city farm in Tower Hamlets.

246
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:23,064
唉 这位仁兄为露脸真是无所不为啊
My God! The things that man will do for publicity.

247
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,345
他是去参观还是被参观呢?
Is he going as a visitor or as an exhibit?

248
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,024
很好笑 汉弗莱爵士    啊?
Very droll, Sir Humphrey. What?

249
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,022
菲利普太太? 我是大臣的宣传秘书普利查德
Mrs Philips? I'm Bill Pritchard, the Minister's Press Officer.

250
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,386
大臣 这位是菲利普太太 农场主管
This is Mrs Philips, the warden of the park.

251
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,302
干的漂亮 您好      您好
How do you do?

252
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:56,781
我是BBC的 没拍到您到达的场景
BBC TV. We didn't get your arrival

253
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,781
能重来一次吗?
could we have it again?

254
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,827
什么?     您能否重新到达一次?      当然可以
Sorry? Could you arrive again?

255
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:05,140
什么叫重新到达? 他已经到这里了啊
How can he arrive again? He's already here.

256
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,186
拍摄需要     行吗?
For the cameras. Do you mind?

257
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,498
什么行吗?
Mind what?

258
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:12,820
就拍个到达场景
Let's see you arriving.

259
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:20,660
这种事常有吗?      对对
Does this often happen?

260
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:23,145
我搞不懂...
But I don't understand...

261
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,749
准备 开拍
Turn over... Action!

262
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,981
大家快挥手
Wave, everybody!

263
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,589
欢迎您 大臣      非常高兴能来这里
Welcome, Minister. It's a great pleasure.

264
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,068
您能来太好了
I'm glad you've come.

265
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,902
我们请过别的名人 谁都不肯来
We tried other celebrities but nobody could come.

266
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,822
停机      怎么啦
Cut. What?

267
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,059
停机停机      停机
Cut, cut, cut! Cut.

268
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,901
这段能掐掉吧?     好 可是...
We'll cut that out, right? Yes, but...

269
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,946
别可是了 掐掉
Not but, cut!

270
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,982
请容许我向您介绍市长阁下
May I introduce you to His Worship, the Mayor?

271
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,744
电视执照税又涨了
Licence fees are coming up again.

272
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,501
好啦 给我讲讲这个
Now, tell me all about this.

273
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:28,105
这是一只小猪
This is a piglet.

274
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,419
不是 讲讲城市农场
No, tell me about this city farm.

275
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,104
哦 有50多座城市农场
There are over 50 city farms

276
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,901
都建在城中荒地
built in urban wasteland

277
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,300
好让难得下乡的城里孩子
to give children who seldom see the countryside

278
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:43,506
有机会观察牲畜和粮食生产
a chance to understand livestock and food production.

279
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:47,423
太周到了 今年是你们第一年吧?
What a wonderful idea! And this is your first anniversary?

280
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,147
是的     恭喜恭喜
Yes. Congratulations.

281
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,063
大臣 能否拍个您向
Could we have a shot congratulating

282
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,063
菲利普太太道喜的镜头?
Mrs Philips for the television?

283
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,618
当然可以 听你们的
Certainly, by all means.

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,246
抢摊登陆是一回事
Fighting on the beaches is one thing

429
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:44,346
赶走动物和小孩
evicting animals and children

430
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:47,740
给收税的腾地可严重多了 啊 汉弗莱
for tax inspectors' cars is another. Ah, Humphrey!

431
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,788
大臣 我看到您昨晚上电视了 非常精彩
Minister, I saw you on television last night. What a treat!

432
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,782
别提电视了 谁关的城市农场?
Never mind that, what about the city farm being closed?

433
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:57,941
对了 财政部...     得阻止他们
The Treasury... It's got to be stopped!

434
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:59,784
可惜这是财政部决议
Unfortunately, it's a Treasury decision

435
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:01,784
我们无权干涉
and beyond our jurisdiction.

436
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:05,504
我要撤回那道命令     恐怕不可行 或很困难
I shall revoke the order. That is impossible. Or difficult.

437
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:08,940
不是上策 违反法律 总之肯定摊上了一项
Or inadvisable. Or requires legislation. One of those.

438
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,146
就算撤销 也不能
Anyway, it could not invalidate an action

439
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:13,546
追溯既往决定
taken while the order was in force.

440
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,223
我不管 就算女王教皇都在...
I don't care if it's the Queen and the Pope...

441
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:21,178
叛徒      什么 不至于吧
Judas! I say, look here.

442
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:23,738
你保证支持我们的     抱歉 我没...
You promised to support us! I'm sorry...

443
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:26,707
你必须让我们续约
You must see that our lease is renewed.

444
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,100
亲爱的女士 恐怕大臣无权...抱歉
My dear lady, it's not in the Minister's p...

445
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,947
哈克先生 你放过话的
Mr Hacker, you have given your word.

446
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,508
你要食言吗?
Are you going to keep it?

447
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,342
我会尽力...想办法...
I shall leave no stone... every avenue...

448
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:43,069
尽一切可能...
everything that is humanly possible...

449
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:45,581
就是不行喽?     不
You mean, no. No.

450
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,748
对 我不会 也就是会 绝对不会
Yes, I mean no. I mean yes. Definitely not. No.

451
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,103
对 我不会
Yes, I mean, no.

452
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,906
很好 别怪我没警告过你
Very well. Don't say I haven't warned you.

453
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,221
我丈夫是每日快报副主编
My husband is Deputy Features Editor of the Express.

454
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,457
明天一早 你就会臭名远播
Tomorrow morning your name will be manure.

455
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:10,386
各大媒体 人人得而诛之
You will be roasted alive by the national press.

456
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,901
不容易啊 一夜之间
It falls to few people to be, in the space of 24 hours,

457
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:23,061
她从圣方济各变成圣女贞德
both St Francis and St Joan.

458
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:27,859
汉弗莱 千万得想办法 不能关农场
Humphrey, something must be done to stop this farm closing.

459
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,499
不然我们会变成...
Otherwise, we shall look a complete...

460
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,547
喂? 戴斯蒙·格雷布克爵士来了
Yes? Sir Desmond Glazebrook is outside.

461
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:34,778
格雷布克 他想干嘛?
What does he want?

462
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:38,464
我还真猜不到     让他进来
I can't imagine. Send him in!

463
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:41,382
反正今天行政部算门户大开了
It's Open Day at the Department!

464
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,542
大臣 我正好路过 有个主意
Minister, I was passing and I've had an idea.

465
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:49,384
如果你批准我们加盖9层的话
If you gave us permission for an extra nine storeys...

466
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:51,028
9层? 不是6层吗
You asked for six!

467
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:55,501
对 可如果你批9层 我们就推迟三期工程
you gave us nine extra storeys, we could postpone phase three

468
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,103
推迟7年 空着这块地      怎样?
for seven years, leaving this site vacant.

469
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,779
今早我读金融时报
I was reading this morning in the Financial Times

470
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:05,305
读到您访问城市农场 精彩之至
about your visit to the city farm, a jolly good wheeze.

471
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:09,544
三期工程那块地就在200码外
Our phase three site is only 200 yards away,

472
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,503
可以拿来扩展农场
so you could use it to extend the farm

473
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:14,503
就算搬过去 也比原来大
or if they had to move, it's a bit larger.

474
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:16,627
我们打算命名为
We thought of calling it

475
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:20,020
"詹姆斯·哈克可爱动物庇护所"
"The James Hacker Cuddly Animal Sanctuary."

476
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,308
反正是"动物庇护所"
Well, "Animal Sanctuary", anyway.

477
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:27,586
9层不算高吧?
Nine storeys isn't very much, is it?

478
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:31,309
"詹姆斯·哈克动物庇护所"
"James Hacker Animal Sanctuary."

479
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,567
汉弗莱你看 政府不能贸然
Government has to be awfully careful

480
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,667
扼杀小企业吧?
about throttling small businesses.

481
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,707
银行并不是小企业
The bank isn't actually a small business.

482
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,781
扼杀之后就是了 伯纳
It would be if we throttled it, Bernard.

483
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:53,182
毕竟 有这么多高楼了 多一幢又怎样?
After all, what is another tower block where there are so many?

484
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,180
是的 大臣 确实如此
Yes, indeed, Minister.

485
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:58,706
我必须重新考虑我的决定
I shall be forced to reconsider my decision.

486
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,697
我想可以批给戴斯蒙爵士6层楼...
We'll be able to give Sir Desmond his six storeys...

487
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:02,869
9层
Nine.

488
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:07,261
给戴斯蒙爵士9层 赶快向媒体发布吧
Nine storeys. Let's make a press announcement.

489
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:09,659
"詹姆斯·哈克动物庇护所"
To the James Hacker Animal Sanctuary!

490
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,548
您不是担心伦敦公共交通嘛
You were worried about London Transport.

491
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,143
伦敦交通部门会很高兴创收的
They will be glad of the extra fares.

492
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:16,867
至于小学操场呢
As for the school...

493
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,259
他们没准还喜欢阴凉呢
They might welcome the shade.

494
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,182
尤其在热天
In the hot weather, certainly.

495
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,739
隐私呢?     隐私是相互的 对吧
And privacy? There are two sides to privacy.

496
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,663
人们也许就爱看那些办公楼里的事
People might enjoy looking at what goes on in those offices.

497
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:32,627
办公楼里总是很神奇的 对吗 汉弗莱?
Extraordinary things go on in offices, don't they?

498
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:33,983
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
