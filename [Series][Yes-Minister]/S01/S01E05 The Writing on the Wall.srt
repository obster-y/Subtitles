大白天下


5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,500
这份报告我仍然不满意 Humphrey
I am still not happy with this report, Humphrey.

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,300
好的大臣 我们很乐意为您重新起草
Then Minister, we shall be happy to redraft it for you.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
-你们已经重新起草三次了  -这么说不准确
- You have redrafted it three times already. - That's not absolutely correct.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
准确 Bernard 我会数数 这是第三稿
Yes, it is, I can count. This is the third draft report.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,600
对 就是说先起草了一次
Yes, quite so, Miniser, Therefore it has been drafted once

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,700
然后重新起草了两次
and subsequently redrafted twice.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,700
别钻牛角尖 Bernard
Don't quibble, Bernard.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
我们很乐意起草第三次
We shall be happy to redraft a third time.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,100
还有第四次 第五次 肯定还有第六次
And a fourth and fifth. And a sixth, no doubt.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
里面说的还不是我想说的 是你想说的
And it still not say what I want it to say, It say what you want it to say.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
-我只想说我想说的  -您想说什么?
- And I want it to say what I want it to say. - What do you want it to say, Minister?

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,800
我们想要它说你想说的
We want it to say what you want it to say.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
本部门当然不想要您说您不想说的
I'm sure the department dosen't want it to say anything you don't want it to say.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,700
不要再绕了
Stop wittering!

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,100
六周前 智库找我们要
Six weeks ago, The Think Tank asked us

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,900
公务员过剩的证词
for our evidence on Civil Service overmanning.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
我向公务员一字一句布置了三回
Three times I have briefed a group of civil servants in words of one syllable

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
每次他们交来的报告都不知所云
and each time they've sent back an totally unintelligible report,

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,200
和我要他们说的刚好相反
saying the exact opposite of what I asked them to say.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
恕我直言 大臣 如果它不知所云
With respect, Minister, how do you know it says the opposite

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
您怎么知道刚好相反?
if it's totally unintelligible?

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
我只想说公务员系统
All I am saying is that the Civil Service

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
严重超编 必须裁员
is grossly overmanned and that must be slimmed down.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,100
正是 报告也是这个意思
Quite so. That is what the report says.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,400
-才不是呢  -是 就是
- No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
才不... 听好 我说的是分阶段
No, it... Look, what I'm talking about is a phased reduction

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
裁掉20万名公务员
in the Civil Service of about 200,000 people.

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,900
你到底能不能写进报告里?
Are you going to put that in this report or not?

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,400
大臣 您本周末拿回去好好研究一番
Well Minitser, perhaps If you [?] take that draft home in this weekend and study it,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
也许会发现它说的正是此意
you might find that it dose in fact saying what you want it to say.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,300
-要是没有呢  -我们总可以重新起草
- And if it doesn't? - Then I can only suggest that we redraft it.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Humphrey 坐下
Humphrey, sit down.

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,000
我明白地问 你能明白回答我吗?
Will you give me a straight answer to a straight question?

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
好吧 大臣 只要您不要求我诉诸
Oh, well, Minister, as long as you are not asking me to resort

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,900
简单粗拙或者大而化之的概括
to crude generalizations and vulgar over simplifications,

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,300
比如“是”或“不是” 我将尽全力服从
such as a simple yes or no I shall do my utmost to oblige.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,700
意思是“是”?
Is that "yes"?

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,100
-是  -好
- Yes. - Right.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
-问题来了  -我以为刚才那个就是
- Well, here is the straight question. - Oh I thought that was it.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
你给研究所的证词 会不会支持我的观点
When you give your evidence to the Think Tank, are you going to support my view

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,000
说公务员严重超编?
that the Civil Service is overmanned [?] or not?

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,100
是或不是
Yes or no!

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,000
讲明白!
Straight answer!

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
大臣 您一定要我明白地讲
Well Minister, If you ask me for a straight answer

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
我只能说 就目前情况
then I shall say that, as far as we can see,

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,500
综观全局 纵览古今
looking at it by and large, taking one time with another,

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
考虑各部门平均水平
in terms of the average of departments,

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,300
分析总结 也许可以认为
then in the final analysis it is probably true to say

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,900
综上所述 概括说来
that at the end of the day, in general terms,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,800
您很可能发现
you would probably find that

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
尽管也许不中听
not to put too fine a point on it,

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,900
无论如何 恐怕前景微妙
there probably wasn't very much in it one way or the other.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,200
现阶段只能如此预期
As far as one can see...at this stage.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
你说“是”还是“不是”?
Is that "yes"? Or "no"?

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
是也不是
Yes and no.

60
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
如果不要你明白回答呢?
Suppose you weren't asked for a straight answer?

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
我会尽量争取时间 大臣
Then I should play for time, Minister.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Humphrey爵士
Sir Humphrey.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
-啊 Bernard 请坐  -谢谢
- Ah, Bernard, sit down. - Thank you.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
-你能来太好了  -我很荣幸
- Good of you to pop in. - It's my pleasure.

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,000
Bernard 你知道部里那份给
Bernard, you know the Department's report

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,900
中央政策评估小组的报告吗?
on the Central Policy Review staff?

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,000
知道 Humphrey爵士
Er, yes, Sir Humphrey.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
我们还没从大臣那里拿回来
We haven't had it back from the Minister yet.

69
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,500
-是的 没有拿来  -为什么没有?
- No, Sir Humphrey. - Why not?

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,400
这个 也许您应该问大臣本人
Er... perhaps you should ask the Minister.

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,600
-不 我就问你 Bernard  -是 Humphrey爵士
- No, I'm asking you, Bernard. - Yes, Sir Humphrey.

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
你好像吞吞吐吐的 Bernard
You don't seem to be replying, Bernard.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
是也不是 Humphrey爵士
Yes and no, Sir Humphrey.

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
-Bernard 你在搪塞我吗?  -绝对没有
- Bernard, are you trying to be impertinent? - Oh no.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
要是我真想搪塞 会成功的
I'm sure I would succeed if I tried.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,200
-请来杯加冰威士忌  -好的 先生 就一杯吗?
- [?] me a Scotch on the rocks, please. - Yes, sir. One, sir?

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,900
对 就一杯
Yes, just one.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Bernard 大臣在好好批公文吗?
Bernard, Has the Minister been doing his boxes properly?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
-当然 他非常尽责  -那到底怎么了?
- Oh, Yes, of course, he's very conscientious. - Then what's going on?

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
-请您去问大臣  -我问你
- Er, perhaps you should ask the Minister. - No, I'm asking you.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
但我是大臣的秘书 要对他负责
But I am the Minister's Principal PRIVATE Secretary, I'm responsible to him.

82
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,500
没错 但你也是公务员
Indeed you are, but you are also a public servant.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
大臣的平均任期不到11个月
The average Minister's tenure is less than eleven months, Bernard

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,400
你可要干到65岁 对吗?
but your career in the civil service will last until you're 65, won't it?

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,300
-对 我希望能  -我也希望 Bernard
- I hope so. - Yes, So do I, Bernard.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
不过 你自己拿主意
However, the choice is yours.

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,800
呃 Humphrey爵士
Er, Sir Humphrey...

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
能否请教一个假设的问题?
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,800
这总是个好办法
That's always a good idea.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,400
好 如果有位大臣 一位完全假设的大臣
Well, suppose a Minister, a purely hypothetical Minister,

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,100
不满意本部门
were to be unhappy with a departmental draft

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
对某委员会的证词草案
of evidence to a committee.

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
如果这名大臣企图
And suppose that Minister were planning to replace it

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
自己重写 参考政治顾问
with his own draft worked out with his political adviser

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
-和他的政党...  -我不敢相信
- and people from his party... - I can't believe it.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
不不 这纯粹是假设
Oh, no, no, of course, but It's purely hypothetical.

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,800
如果这位大臣打算
And suppose that Minister were planning to bring in

98
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,200
拖延交稿 让本部门没有时间...
his own draft so close to the final date for evidence that there won't be any time...

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,200
-不会  -不会
- Wouldn't... - Wouldn't

100
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
有时间重新起草
be any time for the Department to redraft it for him.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,700
怎样?
Well?

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
如果这位假设大臣的首席私人秘书
Suppose this hypothetical Minister's Principal Private Secretary

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
知道了这份
were to be aware of this

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,100
假设的文件 当然出于信任
hypothetical draft, in confidence of course,

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,700
他该不该透露给这个假设部门的
should he pass on this information to the Permanent Secretary

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
常任秘书?
of this hypothetical department?

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,100
当然不该 Bernard
Certainly not, Bernard.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,300
既然这名首席私人秘书出于信任
Not if this Principal Private Secretary had been given

109
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
才得到的消息
the information in confidence.

110
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,000
我也这么认为 Humphrey爵士
That's what I thought, Sir Humphrey.

111
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
来一杯 Bernard?
Have a drink, Bernard.

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,000
还有件事 大臣
There just one more thing, Minister.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,700
给中央政策评估小组的报告
The evidence to the Central Policy Review Staff.

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
-你说智库?  -对 大臣
- You mean the Think Tank? - Yes, Minister.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,900
-怎样?  -你是不是重新起草了你草案的草案?
- What about it? - Have you redrafted the redraft of your draft?

116
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
-你不是要拿回去吧?  -正是
- You don't want it yet, do you? - Yes.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,300
-为什么?  -好为您重新起草
- Why? - So that we can redraft it.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
-没有必要  -我认为有 大臣
- Well that won't be necessary. - I think it will, Minitser.

119
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,200
Humphrey 起草文件不是公务员的特权 知道吗?
Humphrey, Drafting is not a Civil Service monopoly, you know?

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
不 这是门艰深的技艺
No, it's a highly specialised skill

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
非公务员很难掌握
which few outside the Service can master.

122
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,300
胡说 起草最容易了
Nonsense. Drafts is easy.

123
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,000
人人都能玩一把
It's a game anyone can play.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
想玩转就难了
Not without getting huffed.

125
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
能否请您把草案还给我?
So could I have the draft proposal, please?

126
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
没问题 Humphrey
Certainly, Humphrey.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
-什么时候 大臣?  -过一阵 Humphrey
- When, Minister? - Later, Humphrey.

128
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
对 但是具体什么时候?
Yes, but when?

129
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,700
你总说做事不能操之过急
You always say we musn't rush things.

130
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,300
大臣 我必须请您明白答复
Minister, I must ask you for a straight answer.

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,700
哪天?明天?周一?周二?
On what day? Tomorrow? Monday? Tuesday?

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,400
适当的时候 Humphrey
In due course, Humphrey.

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
等机会来临
At the appropriate juncture.

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,700
万事俱备
In the fullness of time.

135
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,000
条件成熟
When the moment is ripe.

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
所有必要程序都走完
When the necessary procedures have been completed.

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
当然不会贸然给你
Nothing precipitate, of course.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
大臣 这事很紧急
Minister, this is getting urgent.

139
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
紧急 Humphrey?今天新词不少么
Urgent, Humphrey? What a lot ot new words we are learning!

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
大臣 请恕我冒昧
Minister, You'll forgive me if I say this,

141
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,200
但我开始怀疑
but I am beginning to suspect

142
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
您对我隐瞒了什么
that you are concealing something from me.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,100
我们两个之间没有秘密 对吗Humphrey?
Surely? You and I have no secrets from each other, have we Humphrey?

144
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
抱歉 大臣 但有时人不得不想到
I'm sorry, but sometimes one is forced to consider

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
事情可能受到操纵
the possibility that affairs are being conducted in a way

146
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
考虑一切情况 前思后想
which all things being considered, and making all possible allowances

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,100
尽管可能比较刺耳
is, not to put too fine a point on it,

148
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,100
也许您不完全坦率
perhaps not entirely straightforward.

149
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,000
坦率不坦率你最懂了
You're the expert on straightforwardness.

150
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,600
那给政策评估小组的草案怎么说?
So what about the draft evidence to the Central Policy Review Staff?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
好吧 既然你问了 Humphrey 还问的这么坦率
Well since you ask, Humphrey, and to be perfectly straightforward,

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
我自己重新起草了一遍
I have redrafted it myself.

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
我不要你再改
I don't want you to redraft it.

154
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,300
我非常喜欢它现在的样子
I'm perfectly happy with it as it is.

155
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
我能否斗胆问句您写了什么?
May I be bold enough to ask what you have said?

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,700
就是我想说的 分阶段裁减公务员
I said what I wanted to say: Phased reductions in the Civil Service.

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
-好的 但是  -Humphrey 你挫败了我的透明政府
- Yes, but I... - Humphrey, You have frustrated me over open government,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,400
挫败了我的节约运动 这次我可志在必得
You have frustrated me over the economy drive, but this time I'm going to have my way.

159
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,500
政党需要它 公众也需要
The party wants it, the public wants it.

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,800
我不得不说 公务员只会采取拖延战术
And I am bound to say all we get from the Civil Service is delaying tactics.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,900
公务员的拖延不能叫“战术”，大臣
Well I wouldn't call Civil Service delays "tactics", Minister,

162
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,900
这是把消极当积极
that would be to mistake lethargy for strategy.

163
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,300
很好笑 Humphrey
Very droll, Humphrey.

164
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,000
但你必须了解 改革是当务之急
But you must realise there is a real desire for radical reform in the air.

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,800
党派联席特别行政委员会
Your Party Select Committee on Administrative Affairs,

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
由我建立 非常之成功
which I founded, it's a casing point, it's a great success.

167
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,500
哦 是吗 有什么成就?
Oh, indeed, what has it achieved?

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
眼下没有 不过我们党派很喜欢
Nothing yet. The party's very pleased with it.

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,500
为什么?
Why?

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
首先 上周一《每日邮报》10吋的专栏
Ten column inches in last Monday's Daily Mail for staff.

171
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
如今政府以专栏长度论成败啦?
Oh I see, The government is going to measures its success in column inches, is it?

172
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
是...不是...
Yes... no...

173
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
是也不是
Yes and no!

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,700
大臣 您要提交的证词
Minister, the evidence that you are proposing to submit

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,000
不仅不真实 更有甚者 还不明智
is not only untrue, it is also, which is much more serious, unwise.

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
这件事我们讨论过
Now, we have been through all this before.

177
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
公务员编制庞大
The expansion of the Civil Service

178
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
是议会立法的结果
is the result of parliamentary legislation,

179
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
与官僚帝国无关
not bureaucratic empire building.

180
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
下次质询 你要我告诉议会
So when the next coming up question time you want me to tell Parliament that it's their fault

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
是他们害公务员队伍这么庞大?
that the Civil Service is too big?

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,900
-可这是事实 大臣  -我不要事实
- But it's the truth, Minister. - I don't want the truth.

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
我要给议会一个交待
I want something I can tell Parliament.

184
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Humphrey 你是我的常任秘书 应该执行我的政策
Humphrey, you are my Permanent Secretary, you are supposed to enact my policies.

185
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,800
可你怎么专门跟我作对
Yet, I still not understand why you seem implacably opposed to me.

186
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,300
我必须知道你站在那边
I must know where you stand on all this.

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
大臣 一个人站的立场 取决于他坐的位置
Where one stands, Minister, depends upon where one sits.

188
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
我猜你是不支持我了?
Am I to infer that you will not support me?

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,700
我们永远支持您 大臣
We will always support you, Minister

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
但要给您扛旗 而不是抬棺材
but as your standard bearer not as you pall bearer.

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
Humphrey 你在说什么呀?
Humphrey, What are you saying?

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,100
我认为再清楚不过了 大臣
I should have thought is crystal clear, Minister.

193
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
不要把报告交给
Do not send this report to a body

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,700
打算发表的人!
whose recommendations are to be published!

195
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
我就是要拿去发表
That is exactly why I'm sending it.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
我不想再听你说了
I don't want to hear anymore about it.

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,100
-我能否再说一件事?  -除非用简单英语
- May I say just one more thing? - Only If it's in plain English.

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
很好 大臣
Very well, Minister.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
如果您非要做这件蠢事
If you are going to do this damn silly thing,

200
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,900
拜托别用这种蠢办法
don't do it in this damn silly way.

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,300
大臣 内阁会议您要迟到了
Minister, I'm afraid you'll be late for Cabinet if you don't in a hurry.

202
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
哦 对了 内阁
Oh, yes. Cabinet.

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
今天上午讨论什么?
What are we talking about this morning?

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
内阁讨论您的提案 关闭土地局
Cabinet is considering your proposals to close down the Land Registry.

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,700
我的提案?
My proposal...?

206
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,000
您记得吗 缩减地方自治政府
Yes you remember, Minister? Reducing the number of autonomous Government Departments.

207
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,600
-是你的提案  -您签字了
- That was your proposal. - You have initialled it Minister.

208
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
-哦 是吗? 写的什么?  -放心 大臣 绝对一致通过
- Oh, have I? What's in it? - Oh, Never mind Minister, It'll all go through on the nod.

209
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
-好吧 东西带齐了?  -齐了
- Got all the stuff? - Yes.

210
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,900
快点 可别迟到
Come on then, mustn't be late.

211
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100
小汉
Humpy...

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
你们部门给智库的证词写了吗?
Have you written your deparment evidence to the Think Tank yet?

213
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
-多少算吧  -怎么讲?
- More or less. - What do you mean More or less?

214
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
-大臣在写  -小汉!
- Well, The Minister's written it. - Humpy!

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
对对 很不明智 可他一定要写
Yes, I know. All very unwise, but he insisted.

216
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
他一个多星期就没干别的
He's been working at nothing else for more than a week now.

217
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,300
你不该让大臣卷进这么深
You should never let Ministers get so deeply involved.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
今天写草案 再不盯紧 他们要定政策了呢
Once they start writing the draft, The next thing we know they'll be dictating at policy.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
是 我明白
Yes, I know.

220
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
-这次会议长吗?  -估计不会
- Is this a lengthy Cabinet? - I don't think so.

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,900
纯粹浪费生命
Ghastly waste of time.

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
没错 可没有我们牵着小手
Yes, but if we're not here to hold their little hands,

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
天晓得他们会干出什么来?
God knows what they might not get up to?

224
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,800
失陪了 巨人 是 大臣
Excuse me, Jumbo. Yes, Minister?

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,900
你知道我提议内阁关闭土地局
I'm recommending to Cabinet to close down the Land Registry.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,900
-是啊?  -为什么?
- Yes? - Why?

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
-为什么?  -为什么?
- Why? - Why?

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
为什么关闭还是为什么提上内阁?
Why are we closing it or why we bringing it to Cabinet?

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,100
-什么?  -什么?
- What? - What?

229
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,100
我为什么要提上内阁?
Why am I recommending it to the Cabinet?

230
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
-您当然知道  -不知道我才问
- Surely you know. - No, that's why I'm asking you. I made the the recommendation.

231
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,200
你说会一致通过 我才提的
You said it would go through on the nod,

232
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
现在首相问起来了
now the PM's started asking everybody about very [odd/old] questions.

233
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
我自己还没读过
And I haven't read my proposal.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,600
因为地方政府部门扩张了9.75%
Beacure there was a 9.75% rise in a number of autonomous Government Departments.

235
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,500
对对 谢谢你
Yes, of course. Thank you.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
抱歉 巨人
I'm sorry about that, Jumbo...

237
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,100
你在限制地方自治政府?
Helping to restrict the growth of autonomous departments?

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
正好跟首相的政策走
That should find favour with the PM policy-wise.

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,900
哦?为什么?
Oh? Why?

240
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
最近时兴削减公务员
Very fashionable simplifying the Civil Service

241
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
特别是研究所出报告之后
especially with this Think Tank recommendation as well.

242
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,500
-报告还没提交吧  -提交了 私下的
- But they haven't report it. - Yes, they have, unofficially...

243
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,600
不会 证词还没收集全呢
Oh they can't, They haven't taken all the evidence yet.

244
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
中央政策评估小组高贵的头脑
The Central Policy Review Staff don't sully their elevated minds

245
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
掺不进证据这种沙子
with anything as sordid as evidence.

246
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
估计他们正建议首相
You may take it that they'll be advising the PM

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
简化政府行政部门
to reduce and simplify the administration of government.

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,800
那我有得忙了 对吧
Well, that'll keep me busy, I suppose. Ah, well.

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
我估计不会
I shouldn't count on it.

250
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
你不指望我－首相的资深政策顾问
Well you surely don't expect me, the PM's Senior Policy Adviser,

251
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
把机密透给一个常任秘书吧
to betray confidences his Permanent Secretary.

252
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
当然 透机密怎么能找同事
Well, not to your colleagues, certainly.

253
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,000
反正午饭前你也会听到小道消息
On the other hand, No doubt the grapevine would inform you by lunchtime.

254
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,200
听到?听到什么?
Inform? Inform us of what?

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
Humphrey 你那位大臣千方百计
Humphrey, you know that Your Minister is always seeking

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,700
裁减公务员队伍
to reduce overmanning in the Civil Service.

257
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,500
这回他成功了
Well, he's going to get his way.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
财政部 内政部和公务员系统
Treasury, the Home Office and the Civil Service Department

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
都提议
have all proposed

260
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,000
废除你们行政事务部
to abolish your Department of Administrative Affairs

261
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
首相对提案微笑了
and the PM is smiling on the plan.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
-真荒唐  -干净利落
- That's absurd. - Clean. Dramatic.

263
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
众望所归 没什么阻力
Very popular politically. No real inconvenience.

264
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,000
你们所有的职能都将由其他部门接手
Let's face it all your functions could be subsumed by other departments.

265
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,200
Jim·Hacker大公无私 牺牲自己
Jim Hacker will win through with a thoroughly public [?] self sacrificing policy.

266
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
首相会给他挂个职 供起来
The PM will probably kick him upstairs.

267
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
神风敢死队Hacker阁下
Lord Hacker of Kamikaze.

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,800
Daniel 这一点都不好笑
I hardly think that's funny, Daniel or likely.

269
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,100
怎么? 他领导过反首相运动
Why not? He ran the leadership campaign against the PM, didn't he?

270
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
这可是首相精彩的一笔 一蹴而就
This could be the PM's master stroke in one fell swoop.

271
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,700
先招安 再封爵 最后架空
Approbation, elevation and castration.

272
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
你知道首相的座右铭
You know the PM's motto

273
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,700
“败则怀恨在心 胜则反攻倒算”
"In Defeat, malice. In Victory, revenge".

274
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
废除我的部门
Abolish my Department.

275
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,600
想都不要想
Out of the question.

276
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
绝对做不到
Simply can't be done.

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
你当然最清楚 Humphrey
Well I'm sure you know best, Humphrey.

278
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,600
顺便 马贩街有个就业中心
Oh, By the way, there's a job centre in the Horse Ferry Road.

279
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
19路公交 下车即到
The No.19 Bus stops right outside.

280
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
-我太震惊了  -你还震惊
- I'm appalled. - You're appalled?

281
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,700
我才震惊呢
I'm appalled.

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,700
真不敢相信 我...太震惊了
I just can't believe it. I'm... I'm appalled.

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,300
-Bernard 你怎么想?  -我震惊了
- What do you make of it, Bernard? - I'm appalled, Minister.

284
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
我也是 震惊啊!
So am I. Appalled!

285
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
让人震惊
It's appalling.

286
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
震惊
Appalling.

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
我简直没法形容
I just don't know how to describe it.

288
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
-震惊?  -震惊! 可这是真的吗?
- Appalling. - Appalling. But I mean is it true?

289
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
他不是吓唬你吧?
You sure he wasn't having you on?

290
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,400
一个部门怎能说废就废
They can't mean to abolish this entire department.

291
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,800
听起来很像真的 对吧?
Well It rings true, doesn't it?

292
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,400
我刚看到了各部门联合提案
I've just see the joint departmental proposal.

293
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,500
白厅里最不缺提案
Whitehall's full of proposals.

294
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,800
Daniel·Hughes是首相的亲信
Daniel Hughes is very close to the PM.

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,700
会发生什么?我会去哪呢?
What's going to happen? Where will I go?

296
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,500
有个传闻 大臣
Well, there is a rumour, Minister...

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,900
传闻? 什么传闻?
Rumour? What rumour?

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,000
工业协调总管大臣
Minister with general responsibility for Industrial Harmony.

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,900
工业协调?
Industrial harmony?

300
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,200
你知道这是管什么 罢工啊!
You know what that means, don't you. That means strikes!

301
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,500
今后全英国的罢工都是我的错
From now on every strike in Great Britain will be my fault.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,400
那太好了
Oh, marvellous.

303
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
您想过我会怎样吗?
Have you considered what might happen to me?

304
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,000
-没 怎样?  -八成会调到农渔部去
- No. What? - I shall probably be sent to Ag and Fish.

305
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,600
余生都用来讨论鳕鱼配额
The rest of my career dedicated to arguing about the cod quota.

306
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,100
至于你 Bernard
And as for you, Bernard,

307
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
你的大臣落了地 你现在的好名声
if your Minister bites the dust, your reputation as a high flyer, such it is,

308
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,700
也全打水漂
will be hit for six.

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,600
你的余生大概要
You'll probably spend your career

310
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,500
呆在交通管理中心 在Swansea(威尔士南郊)
in the Vehicle Licensing Centre in Swansea.

311
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,300
-都是你的错  -我的错
- It's your fault, you know. - My fault?

312
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,500
是你提议削减地方自治部门
It was your proposal to reduce the number of autonomous government departments.

313
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,300
是你提议分阶段削减公务员
It was your proposed to carry out phased reductions of the Civil Service.

314
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,000
我们还是别吵了 想想现在怎么办?
Don't let's argue about that. Point is what are we going to do now?

315
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
我们可以上书
We could put a paper up.

316
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,900
上什么?
Up what?

317
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
-太妙了!  -大臣 您倒说一个?
- Brilliant! - Have you any suggestions, Minister?

318
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
-我不知道 我...  -震惊了?
- I don't know, I'm... - Appalled?

319
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,300
大臣 这次我们一定要齐心协力
Minister, I really do think that we should work together on this.

320
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
-这话我听过  -什么意思?
- I've heard that before. - What do you mean?

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
你所谓齐心协力 就是你出主意我出力
You idea about working together is you telling me what to do, me doing it.

322
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
-不是的 大臣  -你也没办法?
-Not Minister, that isn't true. - You've no suggestions?

323
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,100
我提议让Bernard叫你的政治顾问来
I suggest Bernard could fetch your Political Adviser.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
-Frank? 你要我请教Frank?  -是的拜托 大臣
- Frank? You want me to consult Frank? - Yes, please, Minister.

325
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
还有 大臣 恕我直言...
And Minister, with respect...

326
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,100
别跟我说这个 Humphrey
Please, Don't use that language to me, Humphrey.

327
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,000
-说什么?  -我知道什么叫“恕我直言”
- What language? - I know what "with respect" means in your jargon.

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,300
你在暗示我的建议全都不值一提
It means you are about to imply anything I suggest is beneath contempt.

329
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,900
啊 大臣
Ah, Minister.

330
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,400
这次我是真想齐心协力
I really do mean that we should work together.

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
-我需要您  -你说真的 Humphrey?
- I need you. - Do you mean that, Humphrey?

332
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,000
-是 大臣  -Humphrey 你太好了
- Yes, Minister. - Humphrey, how very nice of you.

333
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,500
大臣 如果首相要搞阴谋
Minister, if the Prime Minister is behind a scheme,

334
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,400
光凭白厅制止不了
Whitehall on its own cannot block it.

335
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
内阁大臣的阴谋很容易制止...改写
Cabinet Ministers' schemes are easily blocked... redrafted,

336
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
但首相就另当别论
but the Prime Minister is another matter.

337
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
我们得从议会和白厅两面出击
We need to fight this in Westminster and as well as in Whitehall.

338
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,100
Frank·Weisel动员后座议员
And Frank Weisel might be able to mobilise the backbenchers on your behalf.

339
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
对 他也许还能发动媒体
Yes. And what about Fleet Street? And he might be able to mobilise the Press.

340
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,500
-Frank 你听到消息了?  -Bernard刚告诉我
- You've heard the news? - Bernard just told me.

341
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,200
有什么建议?
What do you suggest?

342
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,600
我想不出来...我震惊了
I can't think of anything...I'm appalled.

343
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
我们不能跟老母鸡似的自乱阵脚
Mustn't all flap around like a lot of wet hens.

344
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
得设法拯救这个部门
We've got to do something to save this Department from closure.

345
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,400
听好 你找组织秘书动员后座议员
Now listen, I want you through the whip's office to get to the backbenchers in Central House

346
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
趁它出世之前消灭掉
to put a stop to this thing before it starts.

347
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,800
对不起 可是没出世的东西消灭不着
I'm sorry, Minister, I'm quibble again, but you can't actually stop something before it starts.

348
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,400
多谢了 Bernard。 还有Frank...
Thank you very much Bernard. Frank...

349
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,300
没那么容易 Jim 后座议员非常欢迎
It won't be that easy, you know, Jim. It will actually be a very popular move with backbenchers.

350
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,300
发动舆论呢?大臣 您知道:
What about a publicity campaign, Minister? You know:

351
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
“行政救国” “公文之乐”
"Administration Saves the Nation", "Red Tape is Fun".

352
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,000
整版广告登在...
Full page ads in...

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
我瞎想的
It was just an idea.

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
“公文之乐”?
"Red Tape is Fun"

355
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,100
“公文连起你我他”呢?
What about "Red Tape holds the Nation together"?

356
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,600
没办法挽回了 已经大白天下了
Well, there's no doubt about it, the writing's on the wall.

357
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,300
反正应该让公众感谢行政部
We have to think something to make the public to think kindly towards Administration,

358
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,100
-为了欧通卡  -就是
- because of the Europass. - Quite.

359
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
-欧通卡?  -欧洲统一身份证
- Europass? - European Identity Card.

360
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
Bernard 你没告诉大臣?
Bernard, Surely you've informed the Minister?

361
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
大臣 您没看公文盒?
Minister, Didn't you do your boxes last night?

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
没有 我在起草草案的草案呢
No, I was redrafting the redraft of the draft.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
简单说 大臣 欧共体即将颁布
Well, briefly, Minister, Brussels is about to decree

364
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
一种新的欧洲统一身份证
that there should to be a new European Identity Card

365
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,300
供欧洲共同体全体成员使用
to be carried by all citizens of the EEC

366
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
外交部已经准备妥协了
The Foreign Office is quite ready to go along with it

367
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,400
补偿我们硬栽培出去的黄油山
as a quid pro quo for a deal over the butter mountain,

368
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
红酒湖 牛奶海
the wine lake, and the milk ocean,

369
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
羊肉战 鳕鱼堆
the lamb war, and the cod stink.

370
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,900
很显然 首相要您来提出立法
And quite obviously, the Prime Minister wants you to introduce the legislation.

371
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,200
-我?  -对
- Me? - Yes.

372
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
众所周知您是亲欧洲派嘛
Well it's well known that you're pro Europe, you see.

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,100
这也能大大简化行政程序
And it would simplify our administration normly in the long run.

374
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,000
-实在是好主意  -好主意?
- So it's a good idea. - Good idea?

375
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,100
-好主意?  -好主意?
- Good idea? - Good idea?

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
-有什么不好吗?  -这是政治自杀!
- Not a good idea? - Political suicide!

377
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,800
让英国人都带身份证?
Trying to make British people carry compulsory Identification Papers?

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
他们会说这是极权国家的做法
They'll [?] it a Police State again.

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,300
我们打了两次世界大战 就为这个?
Is this what we fought two world wars for, Humphrey?

380
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,200
大臣 这就跟驾驶证差不多
Well Minister, It's really little more than a sort of driving licence.

381
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,800
这是给我落井下石
It's the last nail on my coffin.

382
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
您可以改叫它“欧洲快车”
You might get away with calling it "Euroclub Express".

383
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Bernard 要么闭嘴要么出去!
Bernard, either shut up or get out!

384
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
为什么是我们 不该归外交部吗?
Why do we have to introduce it, Can't the Foreign Office do it?

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
首相也这样想
Well in fact, that was the Prime Minister's original suggestion,

386
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,000
但外交部长说归内政部
but the Foreign Secretary thought this was a Home Office matter

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
内政部说其实
and the Home Office [?took a deal that] it was essentially

388
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,800
这是行政事务 首相同意了
in the administrative matter, and the PM agreed.

389
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
都在踢皮球
They are all playing pass the parcel.

390
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
里面有定时炸弹 能怪他们吗?
Can you blame them when you can hear it ticking?

391
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,300
恐怕按计划 这个身份卡议案
Well I'm afraid The identity card bill is planned to be

392
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,200
是本部门的收山之作
the last action of this Department.

393
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
反欧洲分子该高兴了
Wonderful ammunition for the anti-Europeans.

394
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,400
外交部不知道这会分裂大欧洲吗?
Yes, but don't the Foreign Office realise what the damage this will do to the European idea?

395
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,500
当然知道 所以要支持
Well I'm sure they do. That's why they support it.

396
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
外交部该亲欧洲吧?
Well, sure the Foreign Office is pro Europe, isn't it?

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
是也不是... 原谅我的措辞
Yes and no... if you'll forgive the expression.

398
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,700
外交部亲欧洲 实际是为了反欧洲
The Foreign Office is pro Europe because it is really anti Europe.

399
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,900
公务员团结在这一理念下
The Civil Service was united in its desire to make sure

400
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,200
保证共同市场不能形成
that the Common Market didn't work.

401
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,400
-所以我们打进去  -你在说什么?
- That's why we went into it. - What are you talking about?

402
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,800
大臣 英国的外交目标
Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objective

403
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,300
500年来没有变过
for at least the last 500 years:

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
创造一个分裂的欧洲
To create a disunited Europe.

405
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,600
因此 我们联荷兰制西班牙
In that cause, We have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish,

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,900
联德国制法国
with the Germans against the French

407
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,200
联法国和意大利制德国 联法国制德国和意大利
and with the French and Italians against the Germans and with the French against the Germans against the Italians.

408
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,000
分而治之 您看
Divide and rule, you see.

409
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,500
一贯效果很好 为什么要改变?
Why should we change now, when it's worked so well?

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
这都是老皇历了吧?
That's all ancient history surely?

411
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
对 也是现行政策
Yes, and current policy.

412
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
我们得打进去 从内部攻破
We had to break the whole thing up, so we had to get inside.

413
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,700
我们施加过外力 没有成效
We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn't work.

414
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,200
现在可以从里面把它搅成一锅粥了
Now, that we are inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing.

415
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,100
挑德国反法国
Set the Germans against the French,

416
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
挑法国反意大利 挑意大利反荷兰
the French against Italians, the Italians against the Dutch...

417
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,800
外交部高兴坏了 光辉岁月又回来了
The Foreign Office is terribly pleased, it's just like old times.

418
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,100
但我们都忠于大欧洲理念吧
Surely we're all committed to the European ideal.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
诚然 大臣
Really, Minister.

420
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
不然为什么要增加成员国?
Why are we pressing for an increase in the membership?

421
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,100
一个道理 就像联合国
Well for the same reason. It's just like the United Nations in fact.

422
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,800
群龙无首 人多嘴杂
The more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up,

423
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
它就越发鸡毛蒜皮
the more futile and impotent it becomes.

424
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,300
-这也太世故了吧  -是的
- What appalling cynicism. - Yes.

425
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
我们一般叫做外交 大臣
We call it diplomacy, Minister.

426
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,600
别的国家会怎么看身份证?
How will the other EEC countries feel about having a carried identity papers?

427
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
它们没意见吗?
Won't they resist too?

428
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,700
没有 德国人正合意 法国人不在乎
No, now the Germans will love it, the French will ignore it,

429
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,900
意大利和爱尔兰乱成一团 根本执行不下去
and the Italians and the Irish will be too chaotic to enforce it.

430
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,900
只有英国人受罪
It's only the British will resent it.

431
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,500
-这是成心陷害我  -反正也要废你的部
- I think It's a plot to get rid of me. - They'll be got rid of it anyway when the Department are abolished.

432
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
也许首相要斩草除根
Perhaps the PM wants to make absolutely certain.

433
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,300
-别神经过敏  -大家都要对付你 你也会神经过敏的
- Don't be so paranoid. - Oh no, you will be paranoid if everyone is plotting against you.

434
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,100
-我们支持你 大臣  -对 大臣
- We're on your side, Minister. - Yes, Minister.

435
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,500
-Martin会支持我们  -对 Martin在哪?
- Martin will be on ourside. - Yes that's true, where is Martin?

436
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,300
外交部长大概在下院 大臣 你也该去的
I think the Foreign Secretary is in the House, Minister, where you ought to be.

437
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,900
我们去找他
Let's go and see him.

438
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,900
真让人震惊 Jim
This is appalling, Jim.

439
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
-你就像参孙  -参孙?
- You've done a Samson act and [?]. - Samson?

440
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,100
对 你一心想减少公务员 就动手了
Yes You wanted to reduced the Civil Service bureaucracy and you've done it.

441
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,900
摧垮整座大厦 埋葬了你自己
You've pulled the whole superstructure down and buried yourself.

442
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
-惨胜不如败  -没办法吗?
- A Pyrrhic victory. - No ideas?

443
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
-若能帮忙我当然尽力  -不过我还不明白欧通卡...
- I'd help if I could.- But I don't understand about the Europass...

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
说不过去
It doesn't make sense.

445
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,900
首相看不到它会危害政府吗?
Why can't the PM see the damage it is going to do to the government?

446
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,900
没错 欧通卡是我入内阁以来
Yes I agree, I think this Europass issue is the biggest disaster of the government

447
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
政府最大的危机
since I asked to join the Cabinet.

448
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
您当然不是这个意思 大臣
I don't think you quite mean that, Minister.

449
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
人人都知道欧通卡行不通
Everybody knows this Europass thing won't happened.

450
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,200
但是为了拿破仑奖  首相一定得玩到底
The PM's got to play along with it didn't until after the Napoleon Prize is awarded.

451
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,900
拿破仑奖?
Napoleon Prize?

452
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,300
北约颁的 五年一次
Yes, It's a NATO award given once every five years.

453
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,500
布鲁塞尔开大会 发金奖牌 10万镑奖金
Gold medal, big ceremony in Brussels, 10,000 Pounds.

454
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
这次首相呼声最高
The PM is the front runner this time.

455
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,300
颁给对欧洲统一贡献最大的政治家
It's for the statesman who has made the biggest  contribution to European unity.

456
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
拿破仑以降 如果不算希特勒的话
Since Napoleon. That is if you don't count Hitler.

457
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
所以呢?
So? What...?

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
委员会六周后决议
The awards committee sits in six weeks times.

459
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,000
首相不能最后阴沟里翻船
Well obviously the PM isn't going to rock the boat until it's in the bag.

460
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
“阴沟里不可翻船” (交通管理中心^_^)
You don't put boats in bags.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
-你说什么 Bernard?  -没什么 首相
- What's that Bernard? - Oh, nothing, Minister.

462
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,000
一旦奖到手 首相马上推翻欧通卡
Once the prize is awarded, the PM will obviously dump the Europasses.

463
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Martin 多少人知道拿破仑奖得主?
Martin, How many people know about the winner of the Napoleon Prize?

464
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
-这是最高机密  -你是说人人都知道
- It's top secret. - Oh you mean everyone.

465
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
-不是 最高最高机密  -就是它了!
- No, top secret top secret. - That's it then.

466
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,000
-Humphrey 你没想到吗?  -想到什么?
- Humphrey, don't you see? - See what?

467
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,500
-后座议员 消息泄漏  -威尔士民族党?
- Backbenchers. Leaks. - The Welsh Nationalist party?

468
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,200
不 不 不
No. No. No.

469
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
对不起 外交大臣 我过会再来
Oh sorry Foreign Secretary, I'll come back later.

470
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,900
别 别走 正要找你
No. No. Don't go, the very man.

471
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,100
进来 Daniel
Come on in, Daniel.

472
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,400
-我有一事请教  -我尽量帮忙 大臣
- I want to ask your advice. - I'll give any help I can, Minister.

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,200
但要是木已成舟的事
Oh if it's a question of shutting stable doors after horses have bolted,

474
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
我也为无力挽回
even I am powerless to help [?at my advised].

475
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,600
这事你能出力
I don't think you will be powerless in this case.

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,100
完全是道德困局
It's really a sort of moral dilemma.

477
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
假设一名后座议员
Look, supposing a backbencher want to put down

478
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,200
向首相提问 英国会不会接受欧通卡
a question for the Prime Minister, asking whether the Europass...

479
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,600
哪个议员? 欧通卡是最高机密
Which backbencher? Europass is top secret.

480
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,200
跟拿破仑奖得主一样机密吗?
You mean like the winner of the Napoleon Prize is top secret?

481
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
我想大臣是说假设有议员
I think the Minister meant a hypothetical backbencher.

482
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,200
正是 Bernard 谢谢你
Quite so, Bernard. Thank you.

483
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,100
一名假设的议员
A hypothetical backbencher.

484
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,300
对首相提了个假设的问题
And a hypothetical question to the PM

485
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,000
问英国是不是会接受欧通卡
asking whether or not Britain was going to adopt the Europass.

486
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
-非常不可能  -我同意 非常不可能
- Highly improbable. - Oh, I agree. Highly improbable.

487
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
但如果首相说“会”
But suppose the PM were to answer yes,

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
会打击国内吧?
it would be very damaging in the country?

489
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,300
对
Yes.

490
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,300
如果首相说“不会”
And suppose the PM were to answer no

491
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,700
在欧洲又很尴尬?
it would be very damaging in Europe?

492
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
对首相个人来说
To the PM personally.

493
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,300
拿破仑奖方向
Napoleon prize-wise.

494
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
好 如果这个假设的首相预先知道了
Now, if a hypothetical Minister were to get to hear

495
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
这个假设的问题 他该怎么办?
of this hypothetical question in advance, what should he do?

496
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
唯一办法是保证
The [?] obvious course would be to ensure

497
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,900
永远没人会问 很明显
that the question was not tabled, that must be obvious.

498
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,000
压制议员提问 责任重大啊
Serious business, try to suppres a MP's question.

499
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
不过 没有别的办法
Nevertheless, there is no other course.

500
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,700
想拦住他 也许只能
The only way to stop him might be to get him

501
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
消除他的另一个问题
to put down a question asking the Prime Minister

502
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
要首相澄清传说中
to squash the rumours about the closure

503
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
废除行政事务部的谣言
of the Department for Administrative Affairs.

504
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
哦 我肯定...你怎么会想到...
Oh, but I'm sure... whatever made you think...

505
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,200
没问题 我全力支持
No question about anything but the fullest support...

506
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
昨天你还说废除行政部已经提上议程
But you said only yesterday, that a plan to abolish the Department had been put up,

507
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
首相还朝它微笑
and the PM was smiling on it.

508
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
不 是嘲笑 嘲笑 不是微笑
No, smiling at it! Smiling at it, not on it.

509
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
这个主意荒谬绝伦
The whole idea was ridiculous.

510
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,700
可笑 不值一驳
Laughable. Out of the question.

511
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,500
开玩笑
A joke.

512
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
开玩笑?
A joke?

513
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,900
当然是玩笑 你不会以为...
Must a joke! You didn't imagine...

514
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,400
那由首相办公室发出备忘录
So that a minute from the Prime Minister's office confirming this,

515
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,100
澄清谣言 会在24小时内
and squashing the rumour, will be circulated to all departments

516
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,400
传遍所有部门吧
within 24 hours.

517
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,300
让大家都看到 玩笑嘛
So that we can all share it, jokewise I mean!

518
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,500
你真觉得有这个必要吗?
Do you really think it's necessary?

519
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
有
Yes.

520
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
好吧 肯定有办法的
Well, I'm sure something can be arranged.

521
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
我先失陪
If you'll excuse me.

522
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
将死他了吧
Checkmate, I think.

523
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,500
一击中的
Game, set and match.

524
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,600
Daniel·Hughes能做到吗?
Can Daniel Hughes really fix this?

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
首相自己有想法的吧?
Don't Prime Ministers have minds of their own?

526
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,400
当然
Certainly.

527
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,700
但正像尼克松总统的亲信说的
But as President Nixon's henchmen once said:

528
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,300
“抓住了他们的要害
"When you've got them by the balls,

529
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,400
他们的意志和头脑就为你所制了”
their hearts and minds will follow".

530
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,200
是不是?
Isn't that right?

531
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
正是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
