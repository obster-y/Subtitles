00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,320
专制国家
(“老大哥”是乔治·奥威尔所著《1984》中的独裁者,已成为专制的代名词)

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,100
摄制准备 一分钟后开始录制
Recording in one minute. Studio stand by.

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,110
我们会讨论削减政府的铺张浪费 对吗
We are going to talk about cuts in government extravagance, that's all the thing about, aren't we?

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,412
在结束国家资料库的相关问题后
We'll get to that if we've got time

8
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,512
如果还有时间我们就展开这个话题
after the National Database.

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,908
我可不觉得民众对资料库会感兴趣
I don't think people are really interested in the Database.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,149
如此琐碎
It's so trivial.

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
摄像机就位
VT running.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,914
-这是干吗?  -你的脸看上去太红了(pink有左倾之义)
- What's the matter? - You look a bit too pink.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,992
脸红可不行，《每日电讯报》会怎么评论?
We can't have that, what would the Daily Telegraph say?

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,311
铺天盖地的“我们正在迈向一个极权国家?”
All those questions about "Are we creating a police state?"

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,074
-相信我 这点可以忽略  -得了吧 Jim，你了解我
- I trust we can do without those. - Come on, Jim, you know me.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,276
我不会事先透露提问内容
I don't give out my questions in advance.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,078
请都保持安静
Dead silence now, please.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,639
10秒倒数
Ten seconds...

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,077
5 4 3 2 …
Five. Four. Three. Two...

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,475
晚上好
Good evening.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,632
老大哥正在监视你吗? 更准确来说
Is Big Brother watching you? To be more precise,

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,792
你知不知道政府正在建立你的档案库
do you know the Government is building up a dossier on you.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,151
还起了个听上去并无危害的名字
It's called by the harmless sounding name of

24
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,350
“国家综合资料库”
"National Integrated Database".

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,279
只需轻轻一按 任何公务员都能
It means that at the press of a button any civil servant

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,318
查阅你一生中的每个微小环节
can inspect just about every detail of your life

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,870
纳税 病史档案 失业次数
your tax, your medical record, periods of unemployment,

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,077
孩子的成绩 一应俱全
children's school records, and a lot. And that civil servant

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,196
而这个公务员可能恰好是你的邻居
may happen to be your next-door neighbour.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,393
人们日益关注这一由计算机革命
Well recently there's been mounting concern over this powerful,

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,313
为政府带来的强有力的
even totalitarian weapon that the computer revolution

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,357
极权主义武器
has put into the Government's hand.

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,432
而挥舞这根大棒的人就是
And the man who wields the weapon is the Minister

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,388
行政事务大臣 下院议员James·Hacker阁下
for Administrative Affairs, the Right Honourable James Hacker MP.

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,237
大臣阁下 我们正为一个极权国家添砖加瓦吗
Now, Minister, are we laying the foundations of a police state?

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,275
我很高兴你问了这个问题
You know, I'm glad you asked me that question.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,110
那么 大臣阁下 我们能得到答复吗
Well, Minister, could we have the answer?

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,519
当然可以 我正要回答 如果可以的话
Well, yes of course, I'm about to give it to you, if I may.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,509
正如我所说 我很高兴你询问了这个问题
As I said, I'm glad you asked me that question.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
因为
Because...

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,194
这个问题
it's a question

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,751
许多人在问
a lot of people are asking.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
为什么呢?
And why?

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,796
因为大家愿闻其详
Because a lot of people want to know the answer to it.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,954
就不转弯抹角了
And let's be quite clear about this without beating about the bush,

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,834
这个问题明摆着的事实就是
the plain fact of the matter is

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,596
它的确极其重要
that it's a very important question indeed

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,116
民众有权知道
and people have a right to know.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,992
可是大臣阁下 我们还是没能闻其详
But Minister, we haven't yet had the answer.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,151
不好意思 问题是什么?
I'm sorry, what was the question?

51
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,077
好吧 假设我在访谈中激怒了你
Now look, supposing I annoy you in this interview,

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,629
我怎么知道你不会回到办公室
how do I know you won't go back to your office,

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,314
轻轻一按 提出我的纳税记录
press a button and call up my tax records,

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,153
医疗记录 违归记录
my hospital records, my police record...

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,435
不会 不会
Oh no. No. No.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,273
鲍勃 这不是我们国家的做事方式
Bob, you know as well as I do, that's not the way we do things in this country.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,069
如果资料库不是用来核查民众 那是做什么用的呢?
Then what's the Database for if it's not to check up on people?

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,637
你看 这是个非常有趣的问题
You know, that's a very interesting question.

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,115
是用来保存信息
It's for storing information,

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,477
加速政府的运转
so as to speed up government business

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,878
我们就无需雇佣庞大数量的文案人员
so that we need not take on an enormous influx of clerical staff.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,555
计算机是个大进步 是佳音
Computers are big business and are good news.

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,872
可是 大臣阁下 你要是把信息输入机器
But, Minister, if you put information into the machine,

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,793
你有朝一日就会从机器中读出这些信息
you'll eventually take information out of the machine.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,758
这倒未必
Not necessarily.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,518
这么说 你花了2千5百万英镑
So, you're going to spend 25 million pounds

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,871
收集信息却永远不用?
accumulating information and never use it?

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,997
不是 是的 不是
No. Yes. No.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,240
会有安全措施的
Well, there will be safeguards.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,069
例如?
Such as?

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,395
镜头拉近 他在躲闪鲍勃的问题
Close in on him, Two. Bob's got him on the run.

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,953
摄制 1分45
One minute 45, studio.

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,157
我们会关注所有的可能性
We'll be looking at a whole range of possibilities.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,030
当然 这是件复杂并具有高科技的事情
And of course, it's a complex and highly technical matter.

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,077
冰冻三尺非一日之寒啊
Rome wasn't built in a day.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,594
还在审核中
It's under review.

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,069
当然 这需要假以时日
And of course, these things take time.

78
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,676
大臣阁下 我是在与《改革》的前任编辑谈话
Minister, am I talking to the former editor of Reform

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,592
还是在和一个行政部门发言人呢?
or to a Civil Service spokesman?

80
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,513
我们还没就我提到的安全措施展开论述
We haven't talked about the safeguards I've already introduced.

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,877
例如 我新成立的政治监督办
And there's my new bureaucratic watchdog office, for instance.

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,395
看似不久我们会需要一大群看门狗了
It does look as if we'll need a whole pack of watchdogs before long.

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,159
还是十分感谢
But thank you very much.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,554
好啦 请稍等片刻 我们要核对录影
Right, hold it there studio while we check the tape.

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,409
-如何?  -我想第一节进展的非常好
- How did it go? - Well, I thought... First class Very good indeed.

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,114
我似乎扯多了
I thought I waffled a bit.

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,192
不 大臣阁下 你“太极”打得好极了
Oh no, you stonewalled superbly, Minister.

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,429
去喝一杯?
Time for a drink?

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,676
安全措施展开论述
About the safeguards I've already introduced.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,479
例如 我新成立的政治监督办
My new bureaucratic watchdog office, for instance.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,030
看似不久我们会需要一大群看门狗了
Well Minister, It sounds as if we'll need a pack of watchdogs before very long.

92
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,599
还是十分感谢
But thank you very much.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,794
下周的话题...
In next week's topic...

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,633
-我表现如何?  -大臣阁下 棒极了
- How was I? - Splendid, Minister.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,151
非常庄重 非常得体
Very dignified. Very suitable.

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,390
是的 Humphrey爵士 祝贺你
Yes, Sir Humphrey, I congratulate you.

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,551
Jim现在训练有素
Jim is now perfectly house trained.

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,438
你告诉他什么他就说什么
He says and does exactly what you tell him.

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,194
-打断一下 Weasel先生  -是Weisel
- If you'll excuse me, Mr. Weasel. - Weisel.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,431
你简直就成了行政部门的传声筒了
You just say everything the Civil Service programmes you to say.

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,352
你是人还是喉舌?
What are you, a man or a mouth?

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,873
Frank 非常有趣
Very amusing, Frank.

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,157
一个政治顾问理解这或许不易
It must be hard for a Political Advisor to understand this,

104
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,231
但我只是个公务员
but I am merely a Civil Servant,

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,631
无非是遵照主子的指示
I simply do as I am instructed by my master.

106
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,229
如果部长是个女人你怎么称呼她?
What happens when the Minister's a woman, what do you call her?

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,232
这的确有趣
Yes, that's rather interesting.

108
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,399
1947年那会
We sought an answer

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Edith·Summerskill博士被委任为大臣阁下
when I was Principal Private Secretary and

110
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,555
我是首席私人秘书
Dr. Edith Summerskill,

111
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,712
我们想过解决的方法
as she then was, was appointed Minister in 1947.

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,713
我不太愿意称她为我的“情人”
I didn't quite like to refer to her as my Mistress.

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,513
-怎么解决的?  -还没有定论
- What was the answer? - We're still waiting for it.

114
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,471
还在审核 对吗 冰冻三尺非一日之寒
It's under review, is it? Rome wasn't built in a day. Is it Humphrey?

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,870
-这需要假以时日  -我真的得走了 大臣
- These things take time. - I really must be going, Minister.

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,549
-我也是  -您走之前 我想提醒您
- Me too. - Before you go Minister may I remind you

117
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,149
别忘了明早8点在Paddington饭店见
we meet tomorrow morning at Paddington at 8 o'clock?

118
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,755
-去哪?  -Swansea(威尔士南部港口城市) 大臣阁下
- Where are we going? - Swansea, Minister.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,708
-Swansea？  -您将在市财政会议上发表演说
- Swansea? - Oh yes, You're addressing the Conference of Municipal Treasurers, the license and () in Swansea.

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,995
对
Oh, yes.

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,391
可是还有Newcastle(诺森伯兰郡首府)选举的致词
But Jim, You're due in Newcastle tomorrow night to address the by-election meeting.

122
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,278
-的确如此  -可您无法两个都去
- So I am. - Well you can't do both.

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,590
-我不能两个都去  -Jim，那不过是个公务野餐
- I can't do both, right? - Jim, that's a Civil Service junket.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,274
-补缺选举才重要  -补缺选举很重要
- The by-election's important. - The by-election is important.

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,876
会议在几周前就添加在您的行程表中了 Swansea的人们期待您的到访
Er Minister, the Conference has been in your diary for some weeks. They do expect you to go to Swansea.

126
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,871
Newcastle的人们也期待您的到访
The central house expects you to go to Newcastle.

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,634
-Bernard，他怎么会有两个约会?  -Bernard，我怎么会有两个约会?
- Bernard how come he's double booked? - Bernard how come I'm double booked?

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,473
主要是Newcastle的事没人告诉我
Well, largely because, Minister, nobody told me about Newcastle.

129
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,358
-你为什么不告诉他，Frank?  -你为什么不?
- Why didn't you tell him, Frank? - Why didn't you?

130
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,078
我可记不住每件事
I can't remember everything.

131
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,111
Frank 我最好去Swansea
Frank, I think I'd better go to Swansea.

132
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,396
-决定了?  -是的 最终决定
- Is that a decision? - Yes, that's final.

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,118
首相希望您去Newcastle
The P.M. Expects you to go to Newcastle.

134
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,474
首相?
The P.M?

135
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,955
Bernard 我最好去Newcastle
I think I'd better go to Newcastle, Bernard.

136
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,240
-决定了 Jim?  -是的 最终决定
- Is that a decision, Jim? - Yes, that's final.

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,231
-那我回家了  -就这么定了?
- Now I'm going home. - Is that a decision?

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,753
是的 经过严肃思考
No, no, quite seriously...

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,275
我想你做了错误的决定
I think you've made the wrong decision, Minister.

140
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,749
您到访Swansea已经对外宣告
Your visit to Swansea's been announced, It's in the programme.

141
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,150
-您不能取消  -天哪
- You can't really get out of it. - Oh, Lord!

是的 我是说过 但这次是最终的
Yes, I know I said that before, but this time it is final!

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,320
你要使出全身解数摆平
You'll just have to cope as best as you can, that's all.

177
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,469
没错

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,031
对 很明确

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,119
对
Yes...

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,548
明白了?
Is that clear?

181
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,235
好的
Right!

182
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,193
我们去Paris
We're going to Paris.

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,869
不 我要去Swansea和Newcastle
No, I'm going to Swansea and Newcastle.

184
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,994
-今晚在电视上看我?  -我倒是看到有个人像你
- See me on TV tonight? - I saw somebody who looked like you.

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,991
-这话的意思是?  -什么也不是
- What's that meant to mean? - Nothing.

186
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,879
Frank说我成了行政部门的喉舌
Frank Weisel says I've become a Civil Service mouthpiece.

187
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,234
-是啊  -“是啊”是什么意思?
- Yes. - What do you mean, yes?

188
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,231
-就是是啊  -你是说你同意?
- Well... yes. - You mean you agree?

189
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,834
-当然  -“当然”是什么意思?
- Of course. - What do you mean, of course?

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,310
你可以雇一个人去替你说这些话
I mean you could have hired and actor to say it all for you if he would said it better.

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,948
你为什么不直接用图章签名?
And why not just sign your letters with a rubber stamp?

192
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,509
或者让你的助理代劳
Or get an Assistant Principal to sign them for you.

193
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,079
反正就是他们写的
They write them anyway.

194
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,198
助理不能替代我签名
Assistant Principals do not write my letters!

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,798
行政次长可以
UnderSecretaries do that.

196
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,191
我放弃申辩了 大人
I rest my case, my lord.

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,510
-你认为我成了傀儡?  -是的 我认为是
- You don't think I've become a puppet? - Yes, I do.

198
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,632
也许你该让Piggy小姐做你的工作 她至少比你漂亮
Maybe you shoud get Miss Piggy to do your job. At least she's prettier.

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,392
我不知如何是好
I don't know what to do.

200
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,710
我被工作困住了
I'm just swamped by the work.

201
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,197
Annie 我很失落
Oh, Annie, I'm so depressed.

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,316
既然我们不去Paris
As we're not going to Paris,

203
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,228
至少今晚去街角的饭店吃顿安静的晚餐
let's at least go out for a quiet little dinner tonight at the [?] on the corner.

204
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,035
我不能
No, I can't.

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,714
Bernard要我今晚搞定这三个红盒子
Bernard's told me I have to get through three red boxes tonight.

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,836
你说什么呢 Bernard要求你?
What do you mean, Bernard's told you?

207
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,838
亲爱的 在《改革》做编辑的时候 你可不是这样的
Oh darling, When you edited "Reform" you were quite different.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,275
你投入其中 告诉民众怎么做
You went in, you told people what to do,

209
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,158
按自己的意愿行事
and you got what you wanted!

210
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,471
你不先发制人就会被骑在头上
Either you get them by the throat or they get you by the throat!

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,916
那段日子你撕毁多少文章?
How many articles did you blue penciled and tear up in those days?

212
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,117
-几十篇  -那你现在撕毁过多少公文?
- Dozens. - And how many official papers have you torn up?

213
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,113
-这是不允许的  -不允许?
- I'm not allowed to! - Not allowed to?

214
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,239
亲爱的 你是大臣 可以为所欲为
Darling, you're the Minister, you can do anything you like.

215
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,595
不 Humphrey Frank是对的
No, Humphrey, I've decided that Frank was right.

216
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,034
Bob·McKenzie也是
And Bob McKenzie too.

217
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,839
国家数据库必须用其他的方式建立
The National Database has got to be organised differently.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
是的 大臣阁下
Yes, Minister.

219
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,196
确保安全措施到位
We want all possible built in safeguards.

220
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,351
-是的 大臣阁下  -立刻
- Yes, Minister. - Right away.

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,432
“立刻”的确切意思是?
What precisely do you mean, right away?

222
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,713
就是马上执行
I mean right away.

223
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,231
懂了 你是指马上执行 大臣?
Oh I see, you mean right away, minister?

224
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,234
-Humphrey 确保到位  -好的 大臣阁下
- Got it in one, Humphrey. - Well, Minister...

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,073
或许我该提醒您 我们还尚在内阁成立初期
Perhaps I should remind you that we are still in the early months of this Government.

226
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,719
还有许多工作...
And there's an awful lot to get...

227
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,950
Humphrey 资料库的规章必须现在更改!
The Database rules have got to be changed. Now!

228
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,430
-可是您不能 大臣阁下  -不 我能 我是大臣
- But you can't, Minister. - Yes, I can, I'm the Minister.

229
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,312
是的 大臣阁下 您确实是
Yes, indeed you are, Minister.

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,156
而且是一位卓越的大臣阁下
And quite an excellent Ministerat that.

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,311
Humphrey 别奉承了
Nevermind the soft soap, Humphrey.

232
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,830
我要让所有公民都有权利查阅自己的档案
I want all citizens to have a right to see their own files

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,675
我要立法惩治未经许可的违规查阅
and I want legislation to make unauthorised access to personal files, illegal.

234
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,629
-很好 会被实施  -好极了
- Very well, Minister. It shall be done. - Good.

235
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,196
但要使这项公民权利法案生效
But the legislation necessary to give the public the right

236
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,670
将要通过极其复杂的诉讼
to take legal action is extremely complicated

237
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,039
并且耗费大量时间起草
and would take considerable time to draft,

238
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,598
宣传 颁布
promulgate and enact.

239
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,355
公民查阅自己的档案无需立法 对吗
Legislation isn't necessary for a citizen to see his own files, is it?

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,188
-是的  -那就从这开始
- No... - Then, we'll start with that.

241
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,636
我们将争取快点实施
Well, I suppose we could manage that slightly quicker, Minster

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,110
但还存在许多管理上的难题
but there's an awful lot of administrative problems as well.

243
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,191
Humphrey 先前对此肯定有过研究
Humphrey, this must have been examined before.

244
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,193
多年前资料库就在筹备中
I mean the Database has been in preparation for years. It hasn't just materialized over night

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,999
肯定就此展开过讨论
There must have been discussions about it.

246
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,072
-确实是  -达成的结论是?
- Yes, indeed, Minister. - What conclusions were reached?

247
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,558
Humphrey 达成的结论是?
Humphrey, what conclusions were reached?

248
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,798
我的前任对此抱何态度?
I mean, What did my predecessor want to do about it?

249
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,116
Humphrey 你能听到我说的吗?
Humphrey, can you hear me?

250
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,273
我必须守口如瓶
My lips are sealed.

251
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,109
再说一遍?
I beg your pardon?

252
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,238
我不能公开先前的计划 大臣阁下
I am not at liberty to reveal previous plans, Minister.

253
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,469
为什么不能?
Why not?

254
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,235
大臣阁下 您愿意把您在办公室的一言一行
Minister, Would you like everything that you said and done in the privicy of this office

255
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,358
都告知随后接任您职务的对手吗?
to be revealed subsequently to one of your opponents?

256
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,515
明白 不
I see. No.

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,514
我们不能给您对手政治弹药来对付您 反之亦然
We cannot give your opponents political ammunition against you. Nor vise versa.

258
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,751
可我的前任Tom·Sargent
But Tom Sargent was my predecessor.

259
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
与我是一个政治派系的 他不会介意的?
He wouldn't mind. It isn't a party political matter surely?

260
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,234
原则问题 不能公开
It's a matter of principle, Minister. It just wouldn't be...

261
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,313
我明白 不过我们又不是用来...
I see and we don't want to do anything that wouldn't be...

262
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,515
不行
No.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,150
-打扰下 大臣阁下  -什么事 Bernard?
- Oh, excuse me, Minister. - Yes, Bernard?

264
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,878
小问题 大臣阁下
A slight problem, Minister.

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,037
由于反对的声浪
Because of the adverse...

266
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,113
您的访谈并没有获得一致的赞同
that is say tha not entirely favourable press reaction to your interview last night,

267
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,999
其他频道想让您上他们的节目
the other Channel wants you for their programme [?].

268
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,309
-拒绝  -不去?
Say no. - No?

269
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,913
-是的 不去  -好的 不去?
- Yes, no. - Yes no?

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,912
-是的 拒绝! 最终决定  -要是您这么想
- Yes, say no! That's final. - Well If that's what you want, Minister.

271
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,389
他们说了 就算您不露面 他们还会播出节目
They did say even if you didn't appear, they would go ahead with the item anyway

272
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,313
那时候可就没人替您维护了
and nobody would be there to state your case.

273
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,799
不去? 好吧 去
No? Okay, yes.

274
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,593
不去 好吧 去
No, okay, yes...

275
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,871
-我懂您的意思  -去
- Oh, I see what you mean. - Yes.

276
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,399
最后的最终意见?
Finally final?

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,479
Bernard 谢谢
Thank you, Bernard.

278
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,831
Humphrey  安全措施的问题我该怎么说?
Now, what am I going to tell them about safeguards. Humphrey?

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,560
你可提醒他们 大臣阁下
Well, perhaps you could remind them, Minister,

280
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,915
冰冻三尺非一日之寒
that Rome wasn't built in a day?

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,389
Tom
Tom.

282
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,634
-我的朋友  -介意我坐下吗?
- Oh, my dear fellow. - Mind if I join you?

283
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,119
当然不
No, of course not.

284
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,189
当反对党的滋味如何?
Well, how are you enjoying being in opposition?

285
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,471
执政的感觉如何?
How are you enjoying being in Government?

286
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,811
实际上并非如我期望那般 此刻就不是
Well, not as much as I expected, actually. Well, not at the moment.

287
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,862
Humphrey把你制服了?
Humphrey got you under control?

288
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,991
想做成点事情真难
It's so hard to get things done.

289
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,958
-你办成过什么事吗?  -几乎没有
- Did you manage to get things done? - Oh, almost nothing, oh boy.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,191
我直到选举来临才摸透了他的战术
When I did cotton on to his technique through after been that a year, then there was the election.

291
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,551
-战术?  -拖延战术
- Technique? - Stalling technique.

292
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,674
-拖延战术?  -有五个阶段
- Stalling technique? - It comes in five stages.

293
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,517
首先 他会跟你说内阁新建 尚有许多事务要处理
First, he'll tell you there's lots of administration is very new and there are things to be getting on with.

294
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,915
-他今早就是这么多我说的  -当然了
- He told me that this morning. - Oh, Quite.

295
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,312
其次 如果你仍然坚持 他会这么说
Then, if you still persist, or whatever your idea is, he'll say something like

296
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,677
“好的 大臣阁下 意图很好
"Ah, yes, Minister, I quite appreciate the intention,

297
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,796
确实应该施行
certainly something ought to be done,

298
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,077
但你肯定这是实施它的正确方式?”
but are you sure this is the right way to achieve it?".

299
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,673
我应该记下来
I must make a note of this.

300
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,276
如果你还没有被唬住 他会改变立足点
Now, if you are still undeterred, he will shift his ground.

301
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,272
从告诉你如何做转向何时做
He will shift from telling you how to do it to when you should do it.

302
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,913
他会这么说
You know I mean, he'll say,

303
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,922
“大臣阁下 现在不是恰当的时机
"Now, Minister, this is not the right time,

304
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,440
出于各种原因”
for all sorts of reasons".

305
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,353
-大臣们就裹足不前了?  -多数如此
- [?] And Ministers settle for that? - Well, lots do.

306
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,020
如果你没有放弃
And if you don't,

307
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,433
他会说政策“实施起来困难重重”
well, he'll simply say that the policy "has run into difficulties".

308
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,559
-比方说?  -技术上 行政上 法律上
- Such as? - Technical, political, legal...

309
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,958
法律是最好的托词
Legal are the best sort of course.

310
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,759
他会使其听起来玄乎其玄
Because he can make those totally incomprehensible.

311
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,079
走运的话 这个战术会持续三年
And with any luck, this stalling technique will have lasted for about three years

312
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,800
到了最后阶段 他会告诉你
and you'll be known at the final stage when he says:

313
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,713
“大臣阁下 下一届大选近在咫尺
"Now, Minister We're getting very close to run up the next general election.

314
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,871
你能确保这项政策通过?”
Are you sure you can get this policy through?"

315
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,996
三年 怎么能拖了三年?
Three Years, How has it taken three years?

316
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,596
因为你不督促 Humphrey爵士是绝对什么也不会做的
Well because Sir Humphrey will do absolutely nothing in every stage unless you chase him.

317
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,671
而你偏偏还有一堆事情要做
And you've got far too much to do.

318
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,389
你瞧 他们称之为“创造的惰性”
You see, it's what they call "creative inertia".

319
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,797
你要设法通过什么政策?
What's the policy you're trying to get through anyway?

320
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,918
我试着让国家综合数据库
I'm trying to make this National Integrated Database

321
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,752
少些极权主义
a bit less of a Big Brother.

322
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,192
原来是这么回事
Oh, is that what it is?

323
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,158
-他告诉你这是新政策 对吧?  -是啊
- Now suppose he's told you it's all quite new, was he? - Well, yes.

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,436
我的朋友 这项法案我们耗了几年
My dear fellow, we spent years on that.

325
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,268
我们都备好了白皮书(政府报告)可惜大选来临
We had a White Paper [?] publication when they called the election.

326
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,859
这些我都做过
I've done it all.

327
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,078
-那些行政麻烦呢?  -全都解决了
- What about the administrative problems? - There aren't, I've solved them.

328
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,904
你没有看到任何先前的公文?
Did he tell you couldn't see any of the previous papers?

329
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:24,435
-是的  -不足为奇 都被他抹去了
-Yes. - No wonder. He's wiped the slate clean.

330
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,273
知道他的下一步会怎样吗?
Do you know what his next move's gonna be?

331
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,113
-不知道  -你拿到几个盒子?
- No. - How many red boxes have they giving you tonight?

332
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,430
-3个? 4个?  -5个
- Three? Four? - Five.

333
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,239
他有没有跟你说过不要太担心第5个?
Did he tell you not to worry too much about the fifth one?

334
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,514
-是的  -这就对了 我担保
- Yes. - Right. I'll take a bet.

335
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,992
你会在第5个盒子的底部 找到一个备忘录
You will find at the bottom of the fifth box a little memo

336
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,450
详细解释了为何
which explains exactly why

337
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,954
有关资料库的任何新举措必须暂缓
any new moves on the Database

338
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,276
如果你没能发现
must be delayed. Now If you don't find it,

339
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,637
他将无须盲目行事 但6个月后
he won't do another blind thing, but in six month's time

340
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,588
他会说他早已告知你
he'll say that he has told you all about it.

341
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,835
Tom 你从政多年 对公务员的花招真是无所不晓
Tom you were in office for years. You know all Civil Service tricks.

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,639
谈不上无所不晓 老兄 上百种花招而已
Not all, old boy. Just a few hundred.

343
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,713
那么你是如何让他们违心行事的?
And how do you defeat them, how do you make them do something they don't want to do?

344
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,631
亲爱的朋友 如果我知道就不会在野了
My dear fellow, if I knew that I wouldn't be in Opposition.

345
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,792
可我不理解 汤姆是反对党
But I don't get it. Tom's the opposition.

346
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,598
他为什么告诉你这些?
Why did he tell you all this?

347
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,275
-反对党并不表示敌对  -当然不 我犯糊涂了
- The Opposition aren't the opposition. - Of course not. Silly of me.

348
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,557
-他们只是这么称呼  -他们不过是在野的反对党
- They are called the oppositon. - They're the opposition in exile.

349
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,273
那些公务员才是在朝的反对党
The Civil Service are the Opposition in residence.

350
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,669
Tom说在第5个盒子的底部
Now then, bottom of the fifth box, Tom said.

351
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,798
但就算你知道也无能为力
But even if you know the techniques you can't really do anything.

352
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,109
无能为力?
Oh, can't I?

353
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,754
资料库相关的文件Tom都给我了
Tom's given me all his papers on the Database.

354
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,998
三年的价值
Three year's worth!

355
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,548
了不起
Marvellous!

356
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,233
找到了
Found it.

357
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,749
竟然被夹在一份长达80页的福利措施报告里
It had somehow slipped into the middle of an 80 page report on Welfare procedures.

358
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,069
“安全措施仍在讨论
"Safeguards still under discussion...

359
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,996
计划悬而未决
programme not finalised...

360
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,198
没有任何草率之举
nothing precipitate...

361
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,912
若无相左之指示 建议待发展再定夺”
failing instructions to the contrary, propose await developments".

362
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
显而易见
Typical!

363
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,789
-给Humphrey打电话 说你不同意  -我一早就会见他
- Why not ring Humphrey and tell him your disagree. - I'll see him first thing.

364
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,799
-现在就打给他  -现在可是凌晨2点
- Ring him now! - Now? It's two o'clock in the morning.

365
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,315
-他都要睡熟了  -要的就是这效果
- He'll be fell asleep. - Exactly!

366
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,595
Annie
Annie.

367
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,115
凭什么他安稳入睡你却仍在工作?
Why should he be asleep and you're still working?

368
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,589
他害你白白忙活 现在轮到你整整他
He's had you on the run for weeks. Now it's your turn.

369
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,277
我不能够这么做
I couldn't do that.

370
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,468
他电话多少?
What's his number?

371
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,957
何况材料在第5个盒子里 你根本无法早些看到
Anyway it was in the fifth box, you couldn't have got to it earlier, could you.

372
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,309
有道理
True.

373
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
喂?
Yes?

374
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,834
Humphrey 这么晚打扰你真不好意思
Humphrey, sorry to ring you so late.

375
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,271
我没破坏你晚餐的兴致吧?
I didn't interrupt you in the middle of dinner or anything, did I?

376
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,995
没有 晚餐早结束了
No, we finished dinner some while ago.

377
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,718
现在几点了?
Oh, good. What's the time?

378
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,353
凌晨两点
Er, two a.m.

379
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,539
-我的老天 出了什么大事?  -没有 一切正常
- Good God, what's the crisis? - No. No crisis.

380
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,750
我正在研究盒子
I'm going through my boxes,

381
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,991
而且我知道你肯定也还在鞠躬尽瘁
and I knew you'd still be hard at it.

382
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,192
对的 对的 埋头苦干
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Nose to the grindstone.

383
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,318
那好 我刚看到资料库的文件
Well, I've just come across this Database paper.

384
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,471
您发现... 您看过了!
Oh, you've found... you've read it!

385
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,872
我得说这让我很不满
Thought I'd better tell you straight way I'm not happy with it.

386
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,430
你将有幸为此另寻出路
I knew you'll welcome an opportunity to work on something else right.

387
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,831
-不介意我打电话给你吧  -不 大臣阁下 一点也不
- You didn't mind my calling you? - No. Not at all Minister.

388
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,997
听到您的声音总是非常愉快
Always a pleasure to hear from you.

389
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,952
呀我忘记了，我还要跟他说要在内阁会议前把对策告诉我
Oh damn, I meant to tell him to see me about it before Cabinet.

390
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,393
现在别打给他
Don't ring him now.

391
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,991
是啊 现在是晚了点
No, You're right, it is a bit late.

392
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,831
让他先睡10分钟
Give him another ten minutes.

393
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,037
你最好速战速决
If you could be fairly quick, sir Humphrey.

394
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,839
-他10点要参加内阁会议  -我可以马上解决
- He does have Cabinet at 10. - I can be very quick.

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,037
Bernard “不行”是要对大臣说的最简洁的句子
Bernard, The word "No" is one of the shortest in the language, It's up to the Minister.

396
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,071
抱歉来晚了 今早有许多公文要读
Sorry to be so late. Lots of reading to do this morning.

397
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,995
Bernard 早安 谢谢 George
Good morning, Bernard. Thank you, George.

398
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,633
Humphrey 资料库的事
Now, Humphrey, the Database.

399
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,277
你起草了安全措施的计划书了吗
Have you drafted your proposed safeguards?

400
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,948
大臣阁下 我十分欣赏您的意图
Well, Minister, I quite appreciate your intention

401
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,759
而且非常认同安全措施的必要性
and fully agree that there is need for safeguards,

402
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,433
但是
but is this

403
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,517
-这是实施它的正确方式吗  -是我的方式
- the right way to achieve it? - Well, it's my way.

404
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,519
一个对上了
One.

405
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,158
无论如何 我主意已定
That's my decision, anyway.

406
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,194
出于各种因素现在不是恰当的时机
Well this is not really the time for all sorts of reasons.

407
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,833
两个对上了
Two.

408
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,833
现在正是时候
It's the perfect time.

409
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,515
安全措施应该紧跟系统的步伐
Safeguards should be developed alongside systems, not after them.

410
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,079
这是常识
That's common sense.

411
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,358
之前我们已经有过各种尝试 实施起来困难重重
Yes, but we have tried all this before, Minister. We ran into all sorts of difficulties.

412
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,749
三个了
Three.

413
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,589
比如?
Such as?

414
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,517
-例如技术上  -不 没问题
- Well, technical, for instance. - No. No problems.

415
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,831
我们可以实施与美国国务院
I have been doing a lot of research, We can use the same basic file interrogation programme

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,958
以及瑞典内政部一样的基本档案审核程序
as the U.S. State Dept. and the Swedish Ministry of the Interior.

417
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,753
这个不成问题
No problems there.

418
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,715
好吧 但行政上存在极大的麻烦问题
Yes, but there are also formidable administrative problems, Minister.

419
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,511
各部门都会受到影响
And all departments are affected.

420
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,469
-跨部门委员会...  -不不不 汉弗莱
- An interdepartmental committee... - No. No. No, Humphrey.

421
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,719
我想你会发现 现行的安全手续足以胜任
I think you'll find if you look into the existing security procedures are adequate.

422
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,633
只需简单地完善 还有吗?
This is simply an extension. Anything more?

423
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,031
-还有 大臣阁下  -例如法律上的问题?
- Well, yes, Minister. - Legal problems, for example?

424
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,551
-对 大臣阁下  -很好 很好
- Yes, Minister. - Good, good.

425
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,229
我们有法律上的权限吗?
Do we have the legal power?

426
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:42,429
我可以帮你解答 我们有
I'll answer that. We have.

427
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,592
工作人员的职权受到其协议的约束
All personnel affected are bound by their staff agreements anyway.

428
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,309
是的 但大臣阁下 这将需要额外配备公务员
Yes, but Minister, there will be a need for extra staffing.

429
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,189
你能让其在内阁和议会上通过吗
Are you sure you'll be able to get it through the cabinet and the parliamentary party?

430
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,113
是的 我确定可以 还有其它问题吗?
Yes, I'm quite sure. Anything further?

431
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,157
我看没了 我们可以着手去做了
I don't think so. Right! We can go ahead then.

432
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,559
你沉默不语了 Humphrey
You're very silent Humphrey.

433
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,599
大臣阁下 你似乎没意识到荆棘丛丛
Minister, You don't seem to realise the amount of work that's involved.

434
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,069
当然没有! 难道你曾调查过安全措施的问题?
No, Haven't you examined safeguards before?

435
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,719
我是说在以前的内阁里?
I mean under another government perhaps?

436
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,555
我似乎记得在议会上有过类似答辩
I seem to remember some written answers to parliamentary questions in the past.

437
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,869
首先我们经过协议这是不能...
Well, in the first place that I think we have agreed that question is not...

438
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,358
其次 即便有过调查
In the second place, if there had been investigations,

439
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,795
其实没有 因为没这个必要
which there haven't or not necessarily,

440
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,428
我没有权利去公开
or I am not at liberty to say whether there have,

441
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,591
有这么一个研究小组
there would have been a project team, which,

442
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,035
曾经存在过 我不是在下定论
had it existed, on which I cannot comment,

443
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,634
即便存在过也已经解散了
which would now have disbanded if it had existed

444
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,870
成员各自回到曾经的部门
and the members returned to do their original departments,

445
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,190
如果真的存在过这些成员的话
if indeed there had been any such members.

446
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,398
或者说某些情况下从没存在过
Or not as the case may be.

447
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,674
正是这样 大臣阁下
It's quite so, Minister.

448
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,637
Humphrey 我要安全措施立即实施
Humphrey, I want these safeguards on the Database made available immediately.

449
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,155
-大臣阁下 根本不可能  -可能
- Minister, it is not possible. - It is.

450
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,833
-不可能  -可能
- It isn't. - It is.

451
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,353
-不可能  -可能
- It isn't. - It is.

452
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,193
-不可能  -可能可能可能可能可能可能
- It isn't. - 'Tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis.

453
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,480
大臣阁下 只是提醒您 内阁会议在10点举行
Minster, Just to remind you, you have Cabinet at 10:00,

454
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,756
1点参加英美协会
then you are addressing the Anglo American Society at one,

455
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,117
傍晚接受“聚焦世界”的采访
and you got the "World in Focus" interview, this evening.

456
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,550
连个吃饭的空都没有?
Can't you get me out of the lunch?

457
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,750
很抱歉 大臣 已经对外通告过了
Well not really, Minister. It's been announced, It is in the programme.

458
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,353
我想想 我以为我...
I see... I suppose I...

459
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,714
-你刚说什么 Bernard?  -我们不能更改
- What's that you just said, Bernard? - I said we can't get out of it, Minister.

460
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,110
已经对外通告 已列入日程
It's been announced, it's in the programme.

461
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,319
Bernard 谢谢
Thank you, Bernard.

462
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,158
万分感谢
Thank you very much.

463
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,833
大臣阁下 出于什么?
For what, Minister?

464
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,315
出于一切 Bernard
For everything, Bernard.

465
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,315
聚焦世界


466
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,998
今晚在座的是行政事务大臣
Our Man on the Spot tonight is the Right Honourable Jim Hacker,

467
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,151
Jim·Hacker阁下
Minister of Administrative Affairs,

468
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,710
老大哥式计算机计划争论的中心人物
the man at the heart of the Big Brother computer controversy.

469
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,991
他正在接受Godfrey·Finch的访问
He's talking to Godfrey Finch.

470
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,189
大臣阁下
Minister,

471
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,959
如您所知 本周 民众对于众所周知的
as you know there's been an outcry this week

472
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,200
行政部门官僚正在为每个公民
about the dossier that the Civil Service bureaucracy

473
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,718
建立个人档案一事 大声疾呼表示不满
has apparently been building up on every citizen in this country.

474
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,839
现在传言事实并非如此 您个人的政策是
Now, it's rumoured that this is not in fact, your own policy,

475
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,390
您想为公民们实施安全措施
that you'd like to have safeguards for the individual citizen,

476
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,950
但在玩弄权术的政治舞台上
but that you are being totally frustrated at every stage

477
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,634
您遭到了滑铁卢
of the game by the Civil Service machine.

478
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,036
要知道 Godfrey
You know, Godfrey,

479
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,595
关于行政部门 颇多微词
there's a lot of nonsense talked about the Civil Service.

480
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,196
其实它是非凡而高效的专业机构
It's actually a marvellous, efficient, professional organisation,

481
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,511
充满活力 高速运转
capable of enormous energy and speed.

482
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,116
它汇集了许多有才干的无私奉献的人们
It's staffed by a lot of talented, dedicated people

483
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,676
正尽其所能帮助政府
who do everything in their power to help the Government

484
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,512
将政策转化为法律
make it's policies into law.

485
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,353
感谢您所做的广告 大臣阁下
Well, thank you for the commercial, Minister.

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,309
我们现在可以开始节目了吗?
Perhaps we can start the programme now?

487
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,399
实际上 行政部门和我
The fact of the matter is that the Civil Service and I

488
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,154
在整件事上的看法完全一致
are in complete accord over this whole business

489
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,151
我在此高兴地宣布
and I'm happy to announce that we're now ready

490
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,518
我们已准备好 将此提议公之于众
to put our proposals into publication.

491
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,750
事实上 今晚我可以说 从9月1日起
In fact, tonight I can say that from September the first,

492
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,893
英国的每位公民都绝对的权利
every citizen of the U.K. Will have the absolute right

493
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,599
查阅自己的私人档案 并核查
to inspect his personal file and check any information

494
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,114
任何他未曾向政府提供的信息
that he or she has ever supplied to the Government.

495
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,633
其次
Secondly,

496
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,158
没有大臣的许可 任何公务员将无权
no civil servant will be allowed to examine personal files

497
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,958
查阅其他部门的私人档案
from another department, without written authority from a Minister.

498
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,749
我在此宣布 下周将通过一项法案
And I shall be announcing in the House next week legislation

499
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,356
授权公民能向任何未经许可
enabling citizens to take legal action against any civil servant

500
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,273
查阅其档案的公务员提出诉讼
who gains unauthorised access to his file.

501
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,517
颇令人鼓舞 大臣阁下
Encouraging, Minister.

502
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,997
您为何不早日宣布 让人民不必为此担心?
Why did you not say so in the first place, and put people's minds at rest?

503
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,153
我不确信公务员能在最后期限完成 Godfrey
Thank you, I didn't believe that the Civil Service could meet our deadlines, Godfrey.

504
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,390
但他们让我深信能够做到
But they've convinced me that they can.

505
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,710
而且事实上 我的常务秘书
And, in fact, my Permanent Secretary

506
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,472
以他的名誉向我担保
has staked his reputation on it.

507
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,394
一旦未果 引咎辞职
And if not, heads will roll...

508
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,837
当然 秘书表率
Anyway, Assistant Heads.

509
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,915
大臣阁下 很感谢
Thank you very much, Minister.

510
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,719
-不能施行  -已经在电视上公布了
- It can't be done. - It's been announced on TV.

511
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,236
Bernard 瞧你让大臣都干了些什么
Bernard, what did you make of our Minister's performance?

512
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,756
我 我想这是将了您的军了 Humphrey爵士
Well, I... I think it's checkmate, Sir Humphrey.

513
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,390
Humphrey 昨晚在电视上看到我了吗?
See me on the box last night, Humphrey?

514
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,399
大臣阁下 当然看到了
Of course, Minister.

515
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,630
我表现如何? 不错?
How was I? Good?

516
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,940
精妙绝伦的演出
A most remarkable performance,

517
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,503
大臣阁下 如果我可以这么评价的话
Minister, if I may say so.

518
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,954
-你可以  -谢谢 大臣阁下

经过彻夜的辛苦工作
Well Minister, we have been working very hard all night,

520
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,798
我高兴地告诉您我们赶出了

部分建议草案
with some draft proposals

可以让您在预定时间内
which would enable you to achieve your desired objectives

523
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:00,499
达成目标
by the stated dates.

524
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,825
干得漂亮 Humphrey
Well done. Humphrey

525
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,230
你看 我告诉全国你十分杰出 此话非虚
I told the nation how splendid you were and I was right.

526
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,552
-我对你非常有信心  -大臣阁下 的确如此
- I had every confidence in you. - Quite so, Minister.

527
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,672
你肯定经历了一个难以忘怀的夜晚
You must have had quite a night.

528
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,589
-是 大臣 难忘之夜!  -瞧瞧你的提案吧
- Yes, Minister, quite a night! - Let's see your proposals.

529
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,108
请过目
Here they are.

530
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,438
也来瞧瞧我的
And here are mine.

531
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,551
您也做了详细的建议书?
You have specific proposals too?

532
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,193
我确实做了
Oh, indeed I have.

533
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,636
汉弗莱 把你就安全设施所做的议案大声念出来
Now, Humphrey, you read out what you've got on safeguards,

534
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,837
我同样会念出我的 我们来对照下
and I'll read out what I've got and we'll see how they compare.

535
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,955
“个人资料 第一条:
"Personal data 1A:

536
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,359
安全措施必须以两项原则...
Safeguards must be applied with reference to...

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,788
为准绳
Two criteria.

538
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,753
有无必要与有无权利知道
The need to know and the right to know.

539
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,910
第一小项 有无必要知道
1A1. The need to know

540
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,352
仅将那些
only those officials...

541
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,637
被提供信息的公务员
for whom the information was submitted may be deemed,

初步视为有必要知道”
prime facie, to have a need to know."

543
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,075
汉弗莱 看来我们英雄所见略同
We seem to be of the same mind, Humphrey.

544
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,468
的确 大臣阁下
Indeed, Minister.

545
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,429
这个提案从哪儿得来的?
Where did those proposals come from?

546
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,628
大臣阁下?
Minister?

547
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,993
听到我的话了吗?
Can you hear me?

548
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,273
这个提案从哪儿得来的?
Where did those proposals come from?

549
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,150
汉弗莱 我得守口如瓶
Humphrey, my lips are sealed.
