我可不会这么说
I wouldn't say that.

161
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,700
你问了所有我不希望任何人问的问题
You came up with all the questions I hope nobody would ask.

162
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,826
对手就是要提问的
Opposition's about asking questions.

163
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,060
而政府就选择不回答他们
And Government's about not answering them.

164
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,300
不管怎样 你回答了我所有的问题

177
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,789
然后你会指定你自己的国会私人秘书

178
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,988
他们都会打字吗?
Can they all type?

179
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,749
我们没一个会打字 大臣
None of us can type, Minister.

180
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,389
麦肯夫人打字
Mrs. McKay types.

181
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,741

真可惜 我们都能开个代理处了

-非常幽默 先生  -是的 非常非常有趣

-我想他们都这么说  -当然不是 大臣
- I suppose they all say that. - Certainly not, Minister.

185
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,222
并不是这样
Not quite all.

186
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,660
对 现在该谈正事了
Right, now then, to business.

187
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,030
如果我太迟钝了请你们原谅
You have to forgive me if I'm a bit blunt,

188
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,026
不过我就是这种人...
but that's the sort of chap I am...

189
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,988
看起来 这个部...
Frankly, this depart...

190
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,788
这个椅子有点...
This chair's a bit...

191
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,827
我们可以换一个 大臣
We can change it, Minister.

192
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,221
我们可以换任何东西 大臣
We can change anything, Minister.

193
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,221
家具 装饰品 办公惯例...
The furniture, decor, office routine...

194
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,302
-悉听尊便  -我想要一个新的椅子
- Your wish is our command. - I'd like a new chair.

195
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,664
我讨厌旋转椅
I hate swivel chairs.

196
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,322
人们的确说两种大臣
They do say that there are two kinds of chairs

197
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:10,822
就有两种对应的椅子
to go with the two kinds of Minister.

198
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,662
一种雷厉风行
One sort folds up instantly,

199
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,742
另一种原地转圈
the other sort goes round and round in circles.

200
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,788
好了 先生们 看来这个部门必须
Now, frankly this Department has got to cut

201
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,499
冲破紧绑的官僚体制的束缚
a great swathe through all this stuffy Whitehall bureaucracy.

202
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,104
我们要打开窗子
We're going to throw open the windows,

203
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,150
换些新鲜空气 免去所有的繁文缛节
let in a bit of fresh air, cut through all the red tape,

204
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,744
让这台嘎吱作响的旧官僚机器重焕活力
streamline this creaking old bureaucratic machine.

205
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,344
-你是说一个大扫除?  -就是一个大扫除
- You mean a clean sweep? - A clean sweep.

206
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,820
太多的人就只是坐在桌子后面
Far too many people just sitting behind desks.

207
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,589
当然不是像我们这样了
Not like us, of course.

208
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,389
不过我们必须清除给彼此制造工作的人了
But we've got to get rid of all those people just making work for each other.

209
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,064
-清除掉?  -我想您是说重新部署他们?
- Get rid of them? - I think you mean "Redeploy them".

210
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,506
是的 哦上帝 不 我不是说让他们下岗
Yes. Good Lord no, I don't mean put them out of work.

211
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,423
透明政府 是我的政党的信条
Open Government, that's what my party believes in,

212
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,626
是我们宣言的主要纲领
that was the main plank of our manifesto.

213
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,179
让我们充分相信国家
Taking the nation into our confidence.

214
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,547
这让你耳目一新? 请坐
Now how does that strike you? Do sit down.

215
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,622
事实上 就像你在去年5月2号在议会
In fact, Just as you said in the House on May 2nd last year,

216
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,382
然后是11月23号
and again on November 23rd,

217
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,223
然后在《观察者日报》和《每日邮报》
and in The Observer and in The Daily Mail,

218
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,540
和你的宣言所说的那样
and as your manifesto made clear.

219
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,223
这你都知道?
You know about that?

220
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,950
请看看这些提议 大臣
Please, have a look at these proposals Minister.

221
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,227
这些是使这个政策生效的大体规划
These are the ways to implement this policy

222
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,268
和一个需要你通过的白皮书
and proposals for a white paper for your approval.

223
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,308
那张白皮书就可以叫做"透明政府"
The white paper might be called "Open Government".

224
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,905
-你是说一切都...  -处理好了 大臣
- You mean it's all been... - Taken care of, Minister.

225
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,302
-谁做的这些?  -那台嘎吱作响的旧官僚机器
- Who did all this? - The old bureaucratic machine.

226
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,062
不 说正经的
No, quite seriously.

227
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,430
我们已经为重组做好准备了
We are fully seized of the need for reform.

228
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,026
-而且我们已经提出这个议题了  -我真的很惊讶
- And we have taken it on board. - I'm rather surprised.

229
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,943
我还以为需要不停的说服你们呢
I expected to have to fight you all the way along the line with this.

230
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,419
人们对于公务员的确是有一些有趣的看法
People do have funny ideas about the Civil Service.

231
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,423
我们只是来帮助执行您的政策的
We're just here to implement your policies.

232
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,821
"缩短申请上诉手续的提案"?

Hansard Volume 497, page 1102, Column B.

234
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,623
引自 Hacker先生：
Quote "Mr. Hacker:

235
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,350
“首相是否知道计划所花的程序
Is the Minister aware that planning procedures

236
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,341
使得在20世纪建一栋平房比
make building a bungalow in the 20th century

237
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,308
在12世纪建一栋大教堂还要慢?
slower than building a cathedral in the 12th century?

238
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,109
对手党在狂笑 政府因羞愧而哭泣”
Opposition laughter and Government cries of shame".

239
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,563
他们并没有真的因羞愧而哭泣
They didn't actually cry shame.

240
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,263
的确如此 大臣
Quite so, Minister.

241
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,600
-好吧 我想应该就这些了吧?  -还有一两件事情...

243
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,422
如果您能看看下周的行程表 大臣
If you would just like to check your diary for next week, Minister.

244
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,024
我的行程表? 你又不知道我会来
My diary? You didn't know I was coming.

245
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,862
你甚至都不知道谁会赢得选举
You didn't even know who'd win the election.

246
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,006
我们知道会有一个大臣 大臣
We knew there'd be a Minister, Minister.

247
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:36,306
又来了
Don't start that again.

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,699
很抱歉 尽管我们不知道那会是你
I'm sorry, even though we didn't know it would be you.

249
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,430

250
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,150
能够继续运转 即使没有政治家

251
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,541
-一定很难啦?  -的确...也不是
- Bit difficult surely? - Yes... and no.

Wait Wait a minute...

261
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,582
那我要做的其他事情该怎么办?
What about all the other things I have to do?

262
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:08,382
什么其它的事情?
What otherthings?

263
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,666
我的政党有四个委员会需要我参加

264
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,822
我相信您不想把政党放在国家的前面 大臣
I'm sure you won't want to be putting party before country, minister.

265
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,063

档案盒? 已经开始了吗?

竞选时 我们保留了上一届大臣所作的工作
We get manage to keep the last Minister's work throughout the campaign,

269
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,821
不过我恐怕...这轮不到我去评论
but I fear... well, it's not for me to criticise...

270
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,266
-这是什么意思?  -听起来很刺耳
- What do you mean? - It's a harsh thing to say.

271
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,185
不过有些档案盒带着未完成的工作又回来了
Some of the boxes actually came back with the work not done.

272

如果你在周六晚之前完成前四个的话

你只要做一些主要的政策决定就好

288
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,030
对不起 我们正在和大臣进行私人会议
Do you mind? We are in a private conference with the minister.

289
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,947
-那我也应该在这里  -冷静点 Frank
- Then I should be here, too. - Calm down, Frank.

290
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,659
Humphrey, Frank在这个部门必须有一个自己的办公室
Humphrey, Frank has got to have an office of his own in the department.

291
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,661
-当然了 如果你坚持的话  -我坚持
- Certainly, if you insist. - I do insist.

292
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,460
我相信我们在沃森斯道(偏远地区)还有些空办公室
I do think we have some spare office space in Walthamstow.

293
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,906
-沃森斯道?  -是啊 真让人惊喜
- Walthamstow? - Yes, it's surprising.

294
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,947
政府掌握伦敦所有的地产
The Government owns property all over London.

295
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,183
-我不想在沃森斯道  -那地方在一个很好的地区
- I don't want to be in Walthamstow. - It's in a very nice part.

296
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:50,022
据我所知沃森斯道是个很棒的地方
Walthamstow's a very nice place so I gather.

297
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,101
-我需要在这个楼里有个办公室  -为什么?
- I need an office here in this building. - Why's that?

298
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,908
是的　我同意Frank
Yes, I agree with Frank.

299
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,262
Bernard，我们必须给Weasel先生在这儿找间办公室
Bernard, we must find an office here for Mr. Weasel.

300
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,783
Wiesel.
Wiesel.

301
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,023
所有给我的文件都要给Frank复印一份
Copies of all the papers that come to me go to Frank.

302
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:03,990
-所有的?  -所有的
- All?  - All.

303
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,822
没问题
It shall be done.

304
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,379
所有适当的文件
All the appropriate papers.

305
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,820
你的新大臣怎么样 Humphrey?
How's your new Minister, Humphrey?

306
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,299
以一个新人来说学得的很快
Learning the rules very quickly for a newboy.

307
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,665
-你的新内阁怎么样?  -没问题
- How's your new Cabinet? - No problem.

308
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,900
很难找出和上一届有什么不同
It's hard to tell the differece with the last one.

309
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,545
Arnold, 我听说最近美国的大使
Arnold, I hear the American Ambassador's been spending

310
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,860
经常和首相在一起
a lot of time with the PM.

311
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,182
-是的  -有敌意的还是友好的?
- Yes. - Defence or trade?

312
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,065
两者都有
Both.

313
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,186
那个航天系统的合同?
The aerospace systems contract?

314
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,501
暂时别让内阁听到
Ssh. Don't want the cabinet to hear about it yet.

315
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,183
这个 航空的东西对于首相来讲
This aerospace thingumy would be

316
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,105
应该算是一个妙举 是吗?
rather a coup for the PM, wouldn't it?

317
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,000
是的 现在新首相可以赢得声望了
Yes, now the new PM will take the credit.

318
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,905
很抱歉打扰了 Arnold先生 Humphrey先生
Sorry to intrude Sir Arnold, Sir Humphrey,

319
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,000
如果你能过一下大臣的演讲稿
if you could just OK the Minister's speech,

320
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,070
我就可以把它给议会了
I can get it straight to the House.

321
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,759
好的 当然可以 想加入我们吗?
Yes, of course. Like to join us?

322
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,145
哦 谢谢 Humphrey先生 不过我现在很忙
Oh, thank you, Sir Humphrey, so long as I'm not too long.

323
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,301
给你自己弄杯咖啡吧
Get yourself a cup of coffee.

324
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,262
所以这对首相来说就应该是个羞耻了
So it would be rather an embarrassment to the PM,

325
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,423
不是吗?  如果一个爱幻想的大臣
wouldn't it? if a hypothetical Minister were to rock

326
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,581
想要掀翻英国和美国人的船?
the Anglo American boat?

327
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,342
绝对的羞耻
Grave embarrassment.

328
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,659
多么绝对?
How grave?

329
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,105
我想会是人仰马翻
Man overboard, I should think.

330
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,162
足够缩短一个前途美好的大臣的职业生涯了?
Enough to cut short a promising new Ministerial career?

331
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,622
没有问题
No question.

332
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,548
坐下吧 Bernard
Pull up a chair, Bernard...

333
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,664
说一说你对我们的新大臣的看法
And tell us what you think of our new Minister.

334
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,382
非常不错
Well absolutely fine.

335
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,828
是的 我们会马上就培训好他的
Yes, we'll have him housetrained in no time.

336
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,327
他把整个日程都囫囵吞下了
He swallowed the whole diary,

337
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,668
我想他上周废寝忘食的完成所有的档案盒了?
and I gatherhe did his boxes like a lamb lastweekend?

338
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,465
是的 他都完成了
Yes. Yes he did.

339
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,469
我们必须让他忘掉透明政府这种瞎话
We must head him off this Open Government nonsense.

340
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,582
我以为那些白皮书的名字就是"透明政府"
I thought we were calling the White Paper "Open Government".

341
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,622
是 我们总把难的部分放到题目里
Always dispose of the difficult bit in the title.

342
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,220
放那里比放到文章里要无害多了
Does less harm there than in the text.

343
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,199
你越不想做什么事情
The less you intend to do about something,

344
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,161
就越会不断地说这件事
the more you have to keep talking about it.

345
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,519
不过, "透明政府"有什么不对吗?
What's wrong with open government?

346
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,841
为什么公众不能对正在发生的事知道的更详细些?
Why shouldn't the public know more about what's going on?

347
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,947
你当真吗?
Are you serious?

348
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,058
是啊 我是说 这毕竟是大臣的政策
Well, yes, I mean it's the Minister's policy, afterall.

349
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,460
这个短语本来就互相矛盾
It's a contradiction in terms.

350
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,999
你可以是透明或者你可以有个政府
You can be open or you can have government.

351
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,600
不过 民主政府的公民们当然有权利了解
But surely the citizens of a democracy have a right to know.

352
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,860
不 他们有无知的权利
No. They have a right to be ignorant.

353
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,926
知识代表着阴谋和罪行
Knowledge only means complicity and guilt.

354
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,626
无知倒有一定的尊严
Ignorance has a certain dignity.

355
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,582
不过如果大臣想要这个"透明政府"
But if the Minister wants...

356
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,220
你不能只是让人得其所愿
You don't just give people what they want,

357
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,842
要是这对他们并无好处的话
if it's not good for them.

358
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,463
你会给一个酒鬼白兰地吗?
Do you give brandy to an alcoholic?

359
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,998
如果人们不知道你在干什么
If people don't know what you are doing,

360
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,546
他们就不知道你做错了什么
they don't know what you are doing wrong.

361
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,864
抱歉 先生们 我是大臣的私人秘书 如果他想...
I am the Minister's Private Secretary, and if he wants...

362
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,103
你总不能帮着我们的大臣让他出丑吧
You must not help him to make a fool of himself.

363
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,367
看看我们以往的那些大臣
Look at the Ministers we've had.

364
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,370
要不是他们死命地保住了秘密
Everyone of them would have been a laughing stock in three month

365
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,781
不用三个月就成了别人的笑柄了
had it not been for the most rigid secrecy about what they were up to.

366
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,386
那你有什么建议呢?
What do you propose to do?

367
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,379
-你能保守秘密吗?  -当然了
- Can you keep a secret? - Of course.

368
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,348
我也能
So can I.

369
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,023
请原谅 我得去打个电话
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

370
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,148
我最好把这个还给大臣了
Well, I'd better be getting this back to the Minister.

371
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,220
马丁·威瑟尔有没有拿到
Martin. Has the weasel had a copy of the invoice

372
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,745
新的美国寻址机器的发票复印件?
for the new American addressing machines?

373
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,105
我以为您说那个是机密文件
I thought you said it was sensitive.

374
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,545
的确是这样  今天给他看吧
So it is. Get it to him today.

375
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,738
哦 还有马丁 让他在一摞文件的底部看到它
Oh, and Martin, let him find it near the bottom of the pile.

376
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,544
Jim Jim
Jim, Jim.

377
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,541
-怎么了  -看看我找到了什么
- Yes. - Look what I've found.

378
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,180
-我们这次可抓到他们的小辫子了  -你说什么呢?
- We've got them by the short and curlies. - What're you talking about?

379
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,944
我们抓到 Humphrey·Appleby
We've got Sir Humphrey Bloody Appleby

380
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,560
和太妃糖鼻子 自大的Wolley先生的把柄了
and Mr. Toffee Nosed Snooty Wolley

381
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,898
就在我们想要抓的地方 看这个
just where we want them. See this?

382
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,500
这张看起来很无辜的纸
This innocent-looking piece of paper.

383
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,647
这个政治炸药
Political dynamite.

384
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,270
冷静点  我都不明白你到底在说什么
Calm down. What are you talking about?

385
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,786
这是个一千个监控显示设备终端机的发票
This is an invoice for 1.000 computer video display terminals.

386
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,428
每个一万英镑 也就是总共一千万英镑
At 10.000 pounds each, that is, ten milion pounds.

387
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,903
然后呢?
So?

388
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,668
是匹兹堡制造公司生产的
Made by the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Corporation Inc.,

389
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,549
-从美国进口的?  -是啊
- Imported from America? - I know.

390
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,270
但是我们自己也制造电脑外围设备
But we make computer peripherals in this country.

391
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,898
-就在我自己的选区啊  -就是啊!
- In my constituency. - I know!

392
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,385
-失业问题怎么办?  -就是啊!
- What about unemployment? - I know!

393
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,067
我必须阻止它
This must be stopped.

394
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,427
-Humphrey先生想...哦 对不起  -哦 不 不 进来
- Sir Humphrey to see... oh sorry.     - Oh no. No, come in.

395
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,706
我想见你们两个 快进来
I want to see you both, come on.

396
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,508
Humphrey先生 请坐
Sir Humphrey, take a seat.

397
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,989
谢谢 大臣
Thank you, Minister.

398
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,904
Frank刚刚发现这个关于
Now then, Frank here has just discovered this contract

399
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,823
从美国那里购入价值一千万英镑的
for the import of ten million pound's worth

400
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,299
监视终端的合同
of video display terminals, from America.

401
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,062
我能看一下吗?
May I see?

402
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,241
哦 是的  给白厅的公务员用的
Oh yes. For the whole Civil Service in Whitehall.

403
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,284
-不过这些东西不是英国的  -很不幸 是的
- But they're not British. - That is unfortunately true.

404
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,188
-我们的国家也生产这些东西  -不是同样的质量
- We make these machines in this country. - Not of the same quality.

405
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,023
更好的质量  在我的选区
Better quality. In my constituency.

406
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,379
-我们被告知...  -这个合同必须被阻止
- We were advised...      - This contract must be stopped.

407
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,668
这不在我的权力之内了 大臣 只有财政部才能取消
It's beyond my power, Minister. This can only be cancelled by the Treasury.

408
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,865
为什么?
Why's that?

409
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,067
公务方面关于取消合同有了一个
Would be a major policy change for the Civil Service

410
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,427
重要的政策改变 尤其是海外的合同
to cancel contracts, especially with overseas suppliers.

411
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,462
也许你想和内阁提一下这件事情
If you'd like to take it up with the Cabinet.

412
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,149
我该怎么面对我的政党?
How am I to face my constituency party?

413
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,621
为什么他们需要知道?
Why need they know?

414
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,065
为什么要别人知道?
Why need anybody know?

415
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,220
我们当作什么都没发生
We can see that it never gets out.

416
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,984
-透明政府  -对啊 透明政府
- Open Government. - That's right.Open Government.

417
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,442
如果这个合同不能被取消 那它就应该被公开
If the order can't be cancelled, it must be published.

418
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:10,642
正确  应该公开它
That's right. It must be published.

419
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,298
为什么?
Why?

420
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,986
-为什么 Frank?  -宣言
- Why, Frank?     - The manifesto.

421
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,950
而且会让你的前任看起来像个叛徒
Also it will make your predecessor look like a traitor.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,941
-对 两个无法忽视的原因  -这事不能讨价还价!
- Two unanswerable reasons.     - You didn't bargain for this!

423
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,702
你不会是在建议让
You're not suggesting

424
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,499
大臣在演讲里把这个机密的
that the Minister should make a positive reference

425
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,060
交易作为正面参考吧?
to this confidential transaction in a speech?

426
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,388
演讲  就是这个
Speech. That's it.

427
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,907
Jim 那个国家公众雇主工会的会议的演讲怎么样?
Jim, what about the speech to the Union of office Employees?

428
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,868
我会告诉他们这个可耻的合同
I'll tell them about this scandalous contract.

429
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,861
而且我们今天就要发布出去

我最好把演讲稿给有关部门请求通过

439
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,460
通过?  和别的部门又没关系
Clearance? It got nothing to do with other department.

440
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,287
透明政府要求我们应该和我们的同事

提供给公务官僚的用品
Used by the Civil Service bureaucracy.

456
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,939
所以 我们被美国匹兹堡聪明的
So, we are being fobbed off with second rate American junk

457
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,863
推销员用二等货给欺骗了
by smart Aleck salesmen from Pittsburgh

458
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,464
而英国的工厂却歇业

463
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,380
-打扰一下 大臣 有点事情  -什么事?

-我想你必须看一下 大臣  -那上面写了些什么?
- I do think you ought to read this, Minister. - What does it say?

466

首相打算下个月访问华盛顿

467
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,023
讨论一个价值不菲的英美安防贸易合约

其重要性不可小觑

469
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,379
好啊  天哪 我的演讲已经给媒体了吗?

470
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,666
我想是的 按照您的要求
I presume so, as you requested.

471
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,705
很抱歉 不过首相府已经乱套了
I'm sorry, but all hell's just broken loose at Number Ten.

472
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,703
他们问为什么你的演讲未经审查
They're asking why your speech didn't obtain clearance.

473
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,430
-你怎么回答的?  -我说我们相信透明政府
- What did you say?     - I said we believed in open government.

474
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,979
不过看起来只让事情变的更糟
But it seemed to make things worse.

475
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,108
首相希望在议会见您 马上

The Prime Minister giveth and the Prime Minister taketh away.

不过透明政府是我们宣言的主要纲领

-首相也是这么认为的  -透明 是的  不过不是裂个大洞

-你当大臣多长时间了?  -一周半了

也许你能进吉尼斯纪录了

493
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,067
我已经能看到标题了

497
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,301

那个演讲让首相很焦虑

它确实已经捅到媒体那里了吗?

500
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,178
大臣是在中午下达的直接指令

501
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,784
-不是吗?  -你真是让我惊骇 Humphrey
- Isn't that right? - I'm appalled at you, Humphrey.

502
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,102
你怎么能让首相在甚至没上电视的情况下
How could you let the Minister put himself in this position

503
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:01,102
就置身于这样糟的状况?

504
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,226
我们相信透明政府

不是吗 大臣?
Isn't that right, Minister?

507
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,869
这对政党来说是个好口号
It's good party stuff,

508
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,386
但是这让首相很难堪
but it puts the PM in a very difficult situation.

509
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,427
那我们对透明政府做出的承诺呢?
What about our commitment to Open Government?

510
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,459
看起来这已经是透明政府的最后一季了
This seems to be the closed season for open government.

511
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,822
你要不要考虑一下
Do you want to give thought

512
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,504
写辞呈的草稿?
to a draft letter of resignation?

513
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,898
以防万一...
Just in case...

514
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,220
我们不能把它遮掩过去吗?
Can't we hush it up?

515
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,821
-遮掩?  -是的 遮掩过去
- Hush it up?  - Yes, hush it up.

516
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,381
你是说...把消息压下去?
You mean... suppress it?

517
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,103
是的 就这个意思
Yes, I suppose I do.

518
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,660
你的意思是说 在你安排的
You mean that within the framework of the guidelines

519
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,947
透明政府的指引方针内
about open goverment that you have laid down,

520
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,386
你建议我们应该采用一个更灵活的态度?
you're suggesting we should adopt a more flexible posture?

521
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,745
我是这个意思吗?  哦 是的 是的
Am I? Oh yes. Yes.

522
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,946
大臣 关于记者会...
Minister about the press release...

523
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,183
我们似乎还有
There appears to be a development

524
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:00,183
回转的余地
could precipitate a reappraisal of our position.

525
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,104
我们忘了各部间的审查过程
We forgot the interdepartmental clearance procedure.

526
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,662
附加阻止令起效用了
The supplementary stop order came into effect.

527
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,506
所以 你的演讲还没捅给媒体
So, your speech hasn't gone to the Press.

528
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,504
它只是捅到了首相的私人办公室
It's only gone to the PM's Private Office

529
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,458
而没有首相和外交部的指示
and the Duty Officer had no instructions to pass it out

530
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,269
-行动事务员没有把它公布  -不过为什么呢?
- without clearance of the PM and the foreign office. - But how come?

531
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,904
这全都是我的错 大臣
The fault is entirely mine, Minister.

532
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,826
这个阻止公布演讲的程序是在
The procedure of the holding up of press releases dates back to

533
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,946
确立透明政府之前的事情了
before open government,

534
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,022
我不知为什么忘了废除它了
and I unaccountably omitted to rescind it.

535
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,662
-我希望你能原谅我的过失  -哦 当然了
- I hope you forgive this lapse. - Well, yes, of course.

536
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,502
-当然没问题了  -谢谢 大臣
- That's quite all right. - Thank you, Minister.

537
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,820
毕竟 我们都会犯错误
Afterall, we all make mistakes.

538
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,943
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
