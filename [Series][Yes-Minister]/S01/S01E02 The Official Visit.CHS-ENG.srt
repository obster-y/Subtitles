“尽管1978年苏格兰法案A节第3小节
"Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 3, section A,

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,130
第二百一十四条对此有所规定
clause 214 of the Administrative Procedures Scotland Act 1978,

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
仍然建议
it is proposed that in so far as

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,035
就法律条文的执行而言
the implementation of the statutory provisions is concerned,

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,715
各责任部门间非正常的
the resolution of anomalies and uncertainties

和不确定的情况
as between responsible departments

11

属于行政部
shall fall within the purview of

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,750
大臣权限之内”
the Minister for Administrative Affairs".

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,974
什么意思?
What does it mean?

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,740
-对不起?  -这是什么意思?
- I'm sorry? - What does it mean?

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,972
哦...是这样 大臣
Oh, er, well, Minister,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,270
意思是“尽管法案有所规定...”
it means "notwithstanding the provisions of..."

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,553
别读给我听 我刚读过 到底是什么意思?
Don't read it to me. I've just read it to you. What does it mean?

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,650
就是它说的那意思 大臣
What it says, Minister.

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,050
请允许我提醒您 大臣
May I remind you, Minister.

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,312
还有15分钟您要接见劳工代表团
you are seeing a deputation from the TUC in 15 minutes,

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,957
之后过半小时是全国工联代表
from the CBI half an hour after that,

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,757
中午12点是企业局代表
and from the NEB at 12 noon.

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,000
-他们来想要什么?  -都担心机器设备的事
- What do they all want? - They're all worried about machinery.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,734
-机器?  -是的 担心会通胀、紧缩、以及再通胀
- Machinery? - Yes, for inflation, deflation and reflation.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,500
他们当我是什么
What do they think I am,

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,900
一个内阁大臣 还是自行车打气筒?
a Minister of the Crown or a bicycle pump?

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,394
我什么时候才有时间答复这些信件?
When am I going to do all this correspondence?

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,160
您得知道 其实不用回 大臣
You do realise you don't actually have to, Minister.

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,050
-不用吗?  -要是不想回就不用回
- Don't I? - Not if you don't want to.

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,757
可以草拟一份官方回复
We can draft an official reply.

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,980
官方答复是什么意思?
What's the official reply?

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,156
就是回复“大臣感谢你的来信”
It just says "The Minister thanks you for the letter".

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,196
再说些“正在考虑当中” 类的话
Then we say something like "The matter is under consideration".

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,833
要是您觉得一样 也可以说 “正在积极考虑当中”
Or even, if you feel the same "under active consideration".

35
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,173
有何不同?
What's the difference?

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,077
“在考虑当中”意思是文件已经丢了
"Under consideration" means we've lost the file,

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,869
“在积极考虑当中”的意思是我们正在找
"Under active consideration" means we're trying to find it.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,000
您只要把信件移到这边的文件格
You just transfer all the letters to your Out Tray,

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,169
要是您想看到回复就在边上加批注
put a brief note on the margin if you wish to see the reply

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,420
如果不加 就再也不用去管它了
and if you don't, you never see or hear of it again.

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,200
把东西从这里移到这里 不用去看
If I transfer everything from here to here, without even reading it,

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,131
-我要做的就是这样  -是的
- That's all I have to do? - Yes.

43
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,980
-会有人来处理?  -没错
- It will be dealtwith? - Precisely.

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,770
-处理完毕?  -毫无纰漏
- Properly? - Immaculately.

45
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,400
那大臣是来干什么的?
What's the Minister here for then?

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,275
呃... 来决定政策 大臣
Er... to make policy decisions, Minister.

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,500
当您已经决定政策 我们会来执行
When you've decided the policy, we can carry it out.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,900
需要经常决定政策吗?
How often are policy decisions needed?

49
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,880
有时候需要
From time to time.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,000
Bernard，这届政府是来管理国家的
Bernard, this government is here to govern.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,650
不能像往届那样就是来统治
Not merely preside like our predecessors did.

52
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,000
当一个国家正在走下坡路时
When a country is going downhill,

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
得有人坐在驾驶席上
it's time for someone to get into the driving seat,

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,400
往油门上踩一脚
put his foot on the accelerator.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,900
我想您是指刹车吧
I think you mean the brake.

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,900
-呃 Humphrey  -打扰一会儿 大臣
- Ah, Humphrey. - A moment of your time, Minister.

57
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,670
“Buranda国总统对英国的正式访问”
"The official visit to the UK of the President of Buranda".

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,700
Buranda在哪儿?
Where's Buranda?

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,731
-非洲  -从没听过
- Africa. - I've never heard of it.

60
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,755
是的 大臣 一个很新的国家
Yes, it's fairly new, Minister.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,253
以前叫做英属赤道非洲
It used to be called British Equatorial Africa.

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,200
就是左手边的那个红点 在地中海下面(指地图上)
It's the red bit on the left hand side, below the Mediterranean.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,000
哦 是那儿 为什么交给我?
Oh, there! But why's this come to us?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
这是外交部的事
This is for the Foreign Office.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,000
不 不全是 有些行政问题
No. Not exactly. There are administrative problems.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
女王陛下在Balmoral宫
Her Majesty's due to be up at Balmoral at the time,

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,900
所以要来伦敦
so she'll have to come to London.

68
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,360
国家访问不是几年前就定下来了吗
I thought state visits are arranged years in advance.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,090
这不是国家访问 而是政府首脑访问
This isn't a state visit, it's a Head of Government visit.

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,955
Buranda总统不就是国家首领
Usually the President of Buranda is Head of State.

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,050
但他也是政府首脑 大臣
But he's also Head of Government, Minister

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,050
如果他作为政府首脑而来
But if he's coming as Head of Government,

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,000
还要女王见他干吗?
why does the Queen have to see him?

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,038
因为他是国家首领 大臣
Because she's the Head of State, Minister.

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,500
国家首领来访必须由国家首领来迎接
The Head of State must greet a Head of State,

76
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,200
就算那人不是以国家首领的身份而来
even if he's not here as Head of State.

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
这都是戴帽子的问题 大臣
It's all a matter of hats, Minister

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,000
帽子?
Hats?

79
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,830
是的 他戴着一顶政府首脑的帽子来访
Yes. He's coming wearing his Head of Government hat.

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,200
他也是国家首领 但不能算是国家访问
He is the Head of State, too, but it's not a state visit

81
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
因为他没戴那顶国家首领的帽子
because he's not wearing his Head of State hat,

82
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,120
但外交礼节要求
but protocol demands

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
就算他戴着一顶政府首脑的帽子
even though he's wearing his Head of Government hat,

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
仍必须由女王来迎接他
he must still be met by the Crown.

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,871
为什么我们要接受
Why are we having an official visit from

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,192
-这个非洲弹丸小国的来访?  -大臣阁下
- this tin pot little African country? - Minister,

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,880
我请求您别管它叫做非洲弹丸小国
I beg of you not to referto it as a tin pot little African country.

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,771
-这是个L.D.C  -什么?
- It's an L.D.C. - What?

89
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,734
Buranda就是以前所谓的不发达国家
Buranda is what used to be called an Under-developed Country.

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,392
然而 这种叫法被普遍认为有失礼貌
However, this term was widely regarded as offensive...

91
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,230
于是他们被称作发展中国家
so they became known as Developing Countries

92
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,113
又叫作欠发达国家 即L.D.C.
and then as Less Developed Countries or L.D.C.'s.

93
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,548
现在我们准备把L.D.C这个称呼换成H.R.R.C.
We are now ready to replace the term L.D.C. with H.R.R.C.

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,655
那又是什么?
What's that?

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
-人力资源丰富的国家  -意思是?
- Human Resource Rich Countries. - Which means?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,912
他们人口严重过剩 是来要钱的
They're grossly overpopulated and begging for money.

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,152
Buranda就是个H.R.R.C?
And Buranda is an H.R.R.C?

98
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,060
不 大臣
No, Minister.

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,100
别这么严谨 这算是个富国还是个穷国?
Don't be that strict. Is it one of the "have" or "have not" countries?

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,858
我们也不再用这种称呼了
We don't use that term any longer.

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,117
但是非要这么说的话 Buranda是个“将会富”的国家
But if we did, Buranda would be a "will have" nation.

102
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,734
将会富?
Will have?

103
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,834
两三年后 将会富有大量石油
Will have a huge amount of oil in a couple of years from now.

104
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,720
哦 我明白了
Oh, I see.

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,861
干吗不早说啊?
Why didn't you say so at first?

106
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,820
-它根本不是个T.P.L.A.C.  -T.P.L.A.C?
- It's not a T.P.L.A.C. At all. - T.P.L.A.C?

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,119
非洲弹丸小国
Tin Pot Little African Country.

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,550
绝不是 大臣
No, Minister.

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,459
石油 等等 我有个绝妙的注意
Oil. Wait for a moment. I've got a marvellous idea.

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,000
女王根本不用从Balmoral宫赶到这儿来
The Queen doesn't have to come down from Balmoral.

111
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,110
您是否建议 让女王陛下和那位总统
Are you proposing that Her Majesty and the president should exchange

112
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,800
通过电话互致正式问候?
official greetings over the telephone?

113
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,469
不 不 不 不
No. No. No. No.

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,115
难道您是要他们大声呼喊?
that perhaps you'd like them to shout rather loudly?

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,620
不是 访问应该在苏格兰进行
No. The visit shall take place in Scotland.

116
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,820
-在Holyrood宫  -不可能
- At Holyrood Palace. - Out of the question.

117
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,952
-为什么?  -这不由我们决定
- Why? - It's not our decision.

118
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,618
-这是外交部的事  -不是吧
- It's a Foreign Office matter. - I don't think so.

119
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,275
“尽管法案有所规定...
"Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 3 blah blah...

120
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,553
仍然建议...
it is proposed blah...

121
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,840
各责任部门间非正常的和...
the resolution of anomalies and uncertainties blah...

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,640
属于行政部
shall fall within the purview

123
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,259
-大臣权限之内”  -哦 是的 不过…
- of the Minister for Administrative Affairs." - Oh, yes but…

124
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,888
还不明白? 多棒的主意
Don't you see? It's brilliant.

125
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,951
我们让女王免去了一趟毫无意义的行程
We save the Queen a pointless journey,

126
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,200
正好苏格兰要举行三场补缺选举
and there are three Scottish by-elections coming up soon

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,995
都是边缘选区
everyone of the marginal.

128
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,790
访问一结束就举行
We'll hold them straight after the visit.

129
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,200
大臣阁下 我们不能因为党派政治而
Minister, we do not hold Head of Government visits

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,900
举行政府首脑访问  我们是为了国家
for party political reasons, but for reasons of State.

131
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
可我的计划正表明苏格兰是英国地位平等的一部分
My plan shows that Scotland is an equal partner in the UK.

132
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,450
她也是苏格兰女王 这你明白
She is Queen of Scotland too. You Know.

133
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,100
而苏格兰有很多边缘选...我是说 经济萧条地区
And it is full of marginal constit... I mean depressed areas.

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,718
大臣阁下 我可不认为利用王室
Minister, I hardly think that we can exploit our Sovereign

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,100
就意味着要把女王卷入到所谓的
by involving her in what some might call

136
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,116
肮脏的拉票活动中
a squalid vote grubbing exercise.

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,210
-你需要更好的理由?  -的确需要
- You want a better reason, right? - Indeed we do.

138
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,872
那你告诉我他为何而来
Then tell me why he's coming.

139
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,800
来就共同利益交换意见
For exchange of views on matters of mutual interest.

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,988
-告诉我他是为何而来  -近海石油钻井设备
- Now tell me why he's coming. - Off shore drilling equipment.

141
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,249
希望他会和英国政府签一笔大单子
We're hoping he's going to place a huge order with BG.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,438
他要上哪儿去看这些设备?
And where is he going to see all this off shore equipment?

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,300
-Aberdeen、Clydeside  -没错
- Aberdeen. Clydeside. - Yes.

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
你在Haslemere镇有多少钻塔 Humphrey?
How many oil rigs have you got in Haslemere?

145
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,675
但是行政上的问题…
But the administrative problems…

146
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,740
本部门就是为解决行政问题而建立的
That's what this whole department was created to solve.

147
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,655
-可苏格兰太远了  -也没多远
- But Scotland's so remote. - Not all that remote.

148
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:04,688
就是Potter's Bar镇上面两英寸粉红色的那小块
It's that pink bit about two feet above Potter's Bar.

149
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
这真有趣 大臣
Very droll, Minister.

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,452
好了 就在苏格兰了
So, it's going to be Scotland.

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,000
这就是我决定的政策
That is my policy decision.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,951
我就是来干这个的 是吗 Bernard?
That's what I'm here for, right Bernard?

153
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,297
是吗 Humphrey? 很好 谢谢
Right Humphrey? Good, thank you.

154
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,151
他为什么反对这个主意 Bernad? 我是说 真实原因
What's he got against the idea Bernad? I mean realy.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,650
Humphrey爵士很喜欢参加大使馆的宴会
Well, Sir Humphrey likes going to Foreign Embassies,

156
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,780
打着白领结 身穿燕尾服 胸别勋章 衣冠楚楚
with his white tie, tails, medals.

157
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,000
要是在苏格兰 场面就小多了
It will all be on a much smaller scale of expectation in Scotland.

158
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,499
你是说 Humphrey露面的机会不多?
You mean no room for Humphrey?

159
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,100
基本上没有 只有苏格兰的常任秘书才有机会
Probably not. Only for the Permanent Secretary of Scottish Office.

160
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,890
Humphrey爵士有很多...吗?
Has Sir Humphrey got lots of um...?

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,058
有 大臣 一两枚吧
Yes one or two, Minister.

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,380
他还被推荐为下届高级英帝国勋爵
He's been recommended for the KBE in the next honours list.

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,314
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,772
我以为授勋的事一直是严格保密的
I thought honours were a closely guarded secret.

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,400
-再来点咖啡吗 巨人?  -谢谢 小汉
- More coffee, Jumbo? - Thank you, Humpy.

166
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,000
外交大臣不会同意了这个荒谬的
Any luck with the Foreign Secretary about this

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
苏格兰方案吧?
Scottish nonsense?

168
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,900
恐怕是的 说不动他 你的大臣先把他拉拢了
Afraid not. Can't budge him. Your Minister nobbled him first.

169
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,200
不可能再弄回伦敦了?
No chance of getting it back to London?

170
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,198
不可能了 看来内阁是完全一致
No, I'm afraid the Cabinet are utterly united.

171
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,190
都是为了边缘地区的选票 看出来了吧?
All these marginal seats, d'you see?

172
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
真不要脸
Shameful.

173
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,999
党派政治
Political.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,900
太典型了
Typical.

175
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,128
无法避免
Inevitable.

176
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,812
还这么招摇
And so blatant.

177
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,716
我是说 公然颁布了在访问之后
I mean issuing writs for three Scottish by-elections

178
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,871
举行三场补缺选举的文件
to poll on the day after the visit.

179
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,109
你能想像Harold·MacMillan(首相)会做出这种事吗?
Can you imagine Harold MacMillan doing a thing like that?

180
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,154
能
Yes.

181
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,850
是啊 其实我也认为会
Yes, so can I, actually.

182
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,200
那么 苏格兰那边的安排
Now, about the arrangements for Scotland.

183
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,900
我是说接待 你知道谁会去吗?
The reception I mean. Do we know who's going?

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
是啊 Buranda在爱丁堡的领事馆
Yes. I'm afraid the Burandan Consulate in Edinburgh

185
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,419
恐怕就是个猪圈
is rather a hutch.

186
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,516
还不又得让我一个人
I shall have to carry the flag

187
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,116
为了这些行政事务忙前忙后
for the Civil Service all by myself.

188
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,269
是吗?
Oh really?

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,135
真同情你
Well, you have my sympathy.

190
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,719
天知道他们会给
God knows what they'll be

191
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,700
那些苏格兰人和Buranda人吃些什么
serving up for the Scots and Burandans.

192
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,772
教会调料拌苏格兰羊杂 除了这个还会是什么
Haggis in missionary sauce, I shouldn't wonder.

193
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,000
私下里说 其实很可能不会有什么访问了
Actually, between ourselves, the visit will probably never happen.

194
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,750
-不会有? 为什么?  -内部不太平
- Never happen? Why? - Rumblings in the interior.

195
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,400
哦 天哪… 哦 我明白了
Oh dear... Oh, I see what you mean.

196
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,140
-我们驻Mungoville的人这么说的  -有那么严重吗?
- From our man in Mungoville. - Isn't that rather serious?

197
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,400
Buranda是个友好的非洲国家
Buranda's a friendly African country

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,612
也算是英联邦的友邦
with a Common Wealth connection.

199
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:27,280
我们的情报是它可能会变成一个敌对的
Our information is it's likely to turn into a hostile L.D.C.

200
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,157
跟古巴搭上关系的欠发达国家
With a Cuban connection.

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,700
-政府会怎么做?  -就和以往一样...
- What will the Government do? - The same as always...

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
管他呢!
Damn all!

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,900
(BBC 电视新闻)


204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,578
刚刚收到报导 西非国家Buranda
We are just getting reports of a coup d'etat in Buranda,

205
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,800
也就是前英属赤道非洲发生了政变
the West African State, formerly British Equatorial Africa.

206
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,000
早先的报导说总司令

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,100
还没有迹象表明...
There is still no sign of agreement...

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,850
看到了吗? 快给我接外交大臣
Did you see that? Get me the Foreign Secretary.

212
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,900
要封锁消息吗?
Shall we scramble?

213
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,479
封锁 不 已经不是秘密了 都成新闻了
Scramble. No, it's not secret, it's on the news.

214
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,448
Martin
Martin.

215
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,220
-Buranda这事怎么办?  -怎么回事?
- What's all this about Buranda? - What's all what?

216
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,638
那里发生政变了
There's been a coup d'etat.

217
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
你怎么知道的?

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,900
都上电视了 你没看到吗?
It was on the news. Didn't you see?

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,960
你不知道? 你可是外交大臣啊! 天哪
Don't you know? You're Foreign Secretary! For god's sake.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,150
是啊 可我的电视机出毛病了
Yes. But my TV set's on the blink.

221
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,950
你的电视机? 你不是有外交部电文么?
Your TV set? Don't you get foreign office telegrams?

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,900
不 电文总是晚到 我都从电视上看国际新闻的
No, they always come in later. I get all the foreign news from TV.

223
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,389
-你在开玩笑...对吧?  -不开玩笑
- You're joking... aren't you? - No.

224

-新总统是谁?  -得查清楚
- Who's the new President? - We must find out.

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,130
确保他会来 管他是谁
And make sure he comes. whoever he is.

228
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,250
-还有三场补缺选举靠这个呢  -这我知道
- There are three by-elections hanging on it. - I know that.

229
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,900
一有进一步消息就告诉我
Let me know if you hear anything more...

230
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,000
不 还是你告诉我 你有电视
No, you let me know. You're the one with the telly.

231
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
-听到那个坏消息了吗 大臣阁下?  -是啊 简直是灾难
- You've heard the sad news? - Yes, disaster.

232
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,756
不 不 不 不 只是小小的不便
No. No. No. No, just a slight inconvenience.

233
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,700
轮子已经转起来了 取消访问
The wheels are in motion. Now it's really perfectly simple

234
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,275
不过是件简单的事情
to cancel the arrangements for the visit.

235
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,660
取消访问? 你不能这么做
Cancel the visit? You'll do no such thing.

236
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
我们别无选择 大臣
We have no choice, Minister.

237
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,275
我刚和外交大臣谈过
I've just been speaking with the Foreign Secretary.

238
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,875
我们将重新邀请新总统访问
We are reissuing the invitation for the new President.

239
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,250
可是 我们还没承认他的政府
But, we haven't recognised his government.

240
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,200
轮子已经开始转了
The wheels are in motion.

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,860
-可新总统是谁?  -Mohammed什么的
- But who is he? - Mohammed something.

242
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,120
我们对他一无所知 他到底是什么样的人?
We know nothing about him. What's he like?

243
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,196
Humphrey，他是来访问的
Humphrey, he's coming here on a official visit.

244
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:45,896
我们又不是让他加入国会俱乐部
We're not putting him up after the Athenaeum.

245
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:46,829
大臣阁下
Minister.

246
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,118
Buranda还处于混乱之中
Buranda is in total confusion.

247
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,152
我们不知道谁在为他撑腰
We don't know who is behind him.

248
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,299
我们不知道他是仗着苏联而来
We don't know Whether he's Soviet backed,

249
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,900
还是个只为了敲竹杠而来的普通Buranda人
or just a ordinary Burandan with an eye for the main chance.

250
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,756
我们不能冒外交风险
We cannot take diplomatic risks.

251
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
-政府别无选择  -可是女王陛下...
- The Government has no choice. - But Her Majesty...

252
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,200
女王陛下能够应付 她总能应付
Her Majesty will cope. She always does.

253
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,000
但那人到底是谁?
But who is he?

254
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,513
他可能很没教养
He might not be properly brought up.

255
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,550
他可能对她言行粗鲁
He might be rude to her.

256
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,170
他可能会对女王动手动脚
He might take liberties.

257
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,514
他肯定会跟女王合影
He will be photographed with Her Majesty

258
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,370
那时发现他是又一个ldi·Amin(乌干达暴君)怎么办?
and what if he turns out to be another ldi Amin.

259
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,960
这样的后果将可怕得难以预料
The repercussions are too hideous to contemplate.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
-我们会查清楚他  -我们办不到
- We'll find out about him. - We can't.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,968
在我们眼里他仍是一个谜团
All that we know is that he's an enigma.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,200
Humphrey，我不喜欢这个词
Humphrey, I don't care for that word.

263
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,779
谜团?
Enigma?

264
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,816
国家的大计使这次访问成为必然
And there are reasons of State which make this visit essential.

265
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,000
Buranda资源丰富充满前景
Buranda is potentially and enormously rich.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,700
他们需要钻塔 而我们在Clyde河边的船厂却闲着
It needs oil rigs and we have idle shipyards on the Clyde.

267
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,000
此外 Buranda是我们非洲政策不可或缺的一部分
Moreover, Buranda is essential to our African policy.

268
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,990
政府没有非洲政策
The Government doesn't have an African policy.

269
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,753
那么 现在有了
Well, it has now.

270
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,791
要是真有共产党给他撑腰
And if it is Marxist backed,

271
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,272
谁比女王陛下更合适把他拉拢过来?
who better to win him over to our side than her Majesty?

272
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,318
况且我们已经答应了苏格兰人民
Moreover, the people of Scotland has been promised

273
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:02,908
将在那里举行这次国事活动 我们不能食言
the important state occassion can not go back on ours words.

274
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,000
更不用说为了边缘地区的三次补缺选举
Not to mention three marginal by-elections.

275
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
更不用说那三次...这可与此无关
Not to mention... Which has nothing whatever to do with it!

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,477
当然没有
No, Of course not, Minister.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,050
请说? 是外交大臣
Yes? It's the Foreign Secretary.

278
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,897
Martin? 好 好
Martin? Yes Yes.

279
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,900
访问将如期进行
The visit's on.

280
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,798
哦 太好了
Oh, splendid.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Buranda的新总统已宣布有意
The new President of Buranda has announced his intention

282
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
于下周访问英国
to visiting this country next week,

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,778
和他前任的安排一致
in accordance with his predecessor's arrangements.

284
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,659
看来 外交部终于得到了确定的事实
So, the Foreign Office is getting the facts at last?

285
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,210
其实 也不全是
Well, not exactly.

286
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,800
是Martin的司机从汽车收音机里听到的简讯
Martin's driver heard a newsflash on his car radio.

287
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,333
好了 访问将如期进行
So, the visit's on.

288
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,755
这就是我给首相的提议
That is my recommendation to the PM.

289
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,700
又一项政策决定 Bernard
Another policy decision, Bernard.

290
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,478
还真做了不少决策了呢 是吗?
Quite a lot of them after all, aren't they?

291
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,329
Buranda航空 还真行啊
Burandan Airways! They are doing well.

292
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
-他们有多少飞机?  - 一架也没有
- How many planes do they got? - None.

293
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,100
别犯傻了 那这架呢?
You derisible, What about that one?

294
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,000
这架是上周刚从Freddie·Laker航空公司那租来的
That one was chartered from Freddie Laker last week

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,231
特地重新刷过了
and repainted specially.

296
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,758
实际上 曾有一架747飞机在一个月内
Actually, there's one 747 that belonged to

297
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,556
曾归属于9家不同的非洲航空公司
9 different African airlines in one month.

298
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,449
他们称之为“非洲之神”
They called it the Mumbo Jumbo.

299
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,698
-我的飞机是几点的?  -我给您订了火车卧铺
- When do I have to be in the Heathrow? - Oh I've booked you on the sleeper, Minister.

300
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,000
-您今晚还得去下院  -哦 上帝
- You'll be at the House tonight. - Oh, lord.

301
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,100
现在我们将一睹
And now we are about to catch our first glimpse

302
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
Buranda总统Selim·Mohammed的风采
of President Selim Mohammed of Buranda.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
我认识他! 是Charlie
I know him! That's Charlie.

304
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,832
-Charlie?  -我们是伦敦政治经济学院的同学
- Charlie? - We were at L.S.E. Together.

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,394
他不是什么Selim·Mohammed 他是Charles·Umtali
He's not Selim Mohammed, he's Charles Umtali.

306
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,329
你确信?
Are you sure?

307
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,117
Charles·Umtali这样的名字可不容易忘掉
You don't forget a name like Charlie Umtali.

308
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,200
还有什么资料吗 Bernard?
Have we anything on this, Bernard?

309
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
我查了简介 Humphrey爵士
In the brief it stated

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,396
上面说Selim·Mohammed上校
that Colonel Selim Mohammed

311
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,000
几年前入了伊斯兰教
was converted to Islam some years ago.

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,891
查不到他原先叫什么
We didn't know his previous name,

313
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,430
更别说什么背景了
so we couldn't find out much about his background.

314
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,000
这我倒知道 这家伙是个激进的政治经济学家
Well I can tell you all about him. He's a red hot political economist.

315
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,120
总是先发制人 战胜每个对手
Got the door first, wiped the floor with everyone.

316
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,072
-那就好了  -什么意思?
- Well, That's all right then. - Is it why?

317
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,460
我想Bernard的意思是他既然上过英国的大学
What I think what Bernard means is that

318
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,197
就该知道检点自己的行为
you know how to behave when you went to an English University.

319
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,590
就算是在伦敦政经学院
Even if it was the L.S.E.

320
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,200
你说这人很激进 是指政治上吗?
You said red hot, were you speaking politically?

321
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,980
某种程度上是 跟Charlie在一起会让你迷失方向
Partly. You never quite know where you're with Charlie.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
他是那种跟着你进旋转门
He's sort of person who follows you into a revolving door

323
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,890
出来的时候却在你前面
and comes out first.

324
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
没什么很深的信仰吧?
No deep commitment?

325
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,300
-只对他自己  -我明白了 是个政客 大臣
- Only to Charlie. - I see. A politician, Minister.

326
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,037
很有趣 Humphrey
Very droll, Humphrey.

327
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,250
就待几天 不会有问题
It'll be a couple of days. Can't do much harm.

328
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,857
请千万记住 大臣 是你要他来的 不是我
Always remember, Minister, you wanted him here, not me.

329
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,775
列车半小时后出发 大臣
It is after half past, Minister.

330
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,800
什么时候才能处理这些信件?
When am I going to do all this correspondence?

331
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,870
其实 大臣...
Well, Minister...

332
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,478
干得好 大臣 送出去总比收进来好
Well done, Minister. Better out than in.

333
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,000
十点三十分开往爱丁堡的列车
22:30 Edinburgh train

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,900
将从七号站台发车
will leave from Platform 7...

335
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,690
-谁?  -Bernard
- Who is it? - Bernard.

336
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,200
进来 Bernard 什么事?
Come in. Bernard, what's the matter?

337
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,880
-您看一下这个好吗?  -不 我不看
- Would you read this, please? - No, I will not.

338
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,200
-可情况紧急  -什么事你都这么说
- But it's top priority. - You always say like that at about everything.

339
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,790
这是Selim总统明天演讲稿的复印件
This is an advanced copy of President Selim's speech tomorrow.

340
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,990
我们刚从Buranda大使馆拿到
We just got it from the Brianda Embassy

341
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,232
我了解这种演讲
I know about these speeches:

342
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,200
很高兴来到贵国 什么互相交流的重要性啊
Happy to be here, bonds of shared experience,

343
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,150
两国间的联系啊 是这样吗?
Ties between our two countries, am I right?

344
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,815
是的 里面都写了 可是...
Oh, yes. That is all in it, but...

345
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,550
我今晚可不会看这个
I'm certainly not going to read it tonight.

346
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,200
大臣 我真觉得您该看一下
I really think you should, Minister..

347
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,100
重点我已经用红笔划出来了
I've underlined the important bits in red ink.

348
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,300
我再到其他车厢发几份
I'll just distribute some copies around the train.

349
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
其他车厢?
Around the train?

350
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,100
是的 Humphrey爵士 外交大臣
Yes. To Sir Humphrey, the Foreign Secretary,

351
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,500
新闻官都在列车上
the Press Officer all on the train...

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
“Buranda人民感到自己
"Burandans feel

353
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,650
和他们的共同战友…
a special affinity with the…

354
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,800
所有凯尔特人后代
Celtic peoples

355
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
在争取民族自由的斗争中有着共鸣
in their struggle for freedom.

356
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,400
我们都面临着为摆脱
We too had to fight to break free

357
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,760
英殖民主义而战的艰巨任务”
from the chains of British colonialism".

358
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,500
英殖民主义?
Bristish colonialism?

359
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,800
“Buranda人民催促苏格兰人和爱尔兰人
"The people of Buranda urge the Scots and the Irish

360
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,200
结束英国的压迫 摆脱帝国主义的枷锁
to end the English oppression, cast off the imperialist yoke

361
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,632
加入到自由国家的行列中”
and join the fellowship of free nations".

362
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,719
我的天!
Good God!

363
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,688
请进
Yes.

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
哦 大臣
Well, Minister.

365
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,690
要是被抓到不穿裤子我们就好看了
We would appear to have been caught with our trousers down.

366
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,656
Humphrey 他怎么能当着女王的面讲这个
Humphrey, he can't say this in front of her.

367
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,400
我无意冒犯 但我的确提醒过你了
I don't like to say I told you so, but I told you so.

368
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,790
这下脸上挂不住了
Egg all over our faces.

369
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,090
挂得住 大臣 只是挂得是帝国主义的“枷锁”
Not egg, Minister, just imperialist "yoke".

370
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,476
周四在苏格兰还有三次补缺选举
Three Scottish by-elections on Thursday.

371
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:36,000
是啊 这的确是场灾难 一场悲剧
Oh, yes. It is indeed a catastrophe. A tragedy.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,200
震荡 天谴 空前的浩劫
A cataclysmic, apocalyptic, monumental calamity.

373
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,990
-是你造成的  -Humphrey 付你工资就是要你给我建议!
- And you did it. - Humphrey, you're paid to advise me, advise me!

374
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,200
我可不喜欢在泰坦尼克号撞上冰山后
This is not I like trying to advise the Captain of the Titanic

375
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,700
再给船长您提建议
after he's struck the iceberg.

376
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,680
必须做点什么
There must be something we can do.

377
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,100
我们唱“救主同住”如何?
We could sing Abide with Me?

378
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
-请进?  -大臣
- Yes? - Minister.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,900
外交大臣要见您
The Foreign Secretary would like a word.

380
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
-外交大臣  -你看过了吗?
- Ah, Foreign Secretary. - Have you read this...?

381
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,790
是啊 大臣正担心政府的脸上
Yes. My Minister is concerned that our government

382
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,911
会被丢鸡蛋了 大概是苏格兰鸡蛋吧
will have egg all over our face. Scotch egg, presumably.

383
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
他为什么这么做?
Why is he doing it?

384
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,258
大概是说给国内听的 他刚当上总统
Maybe it's for home consumption. He's only just taken over.

385
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,300
或许他要让其他非洲国家领导人相信
Perhaps he's trying to persuade the other African Leaders

386
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,214
他是个真正的反殖民主义者
that he's a pukka anticolonialist.

387
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,249
-请进 -什么事 Bernard?
- Yes? - Yes, Bernard?

388
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,150
新闻官要见您
The Press Officer would like a word.

389
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,394
天哪!
Oh dear!

390
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,513
还能站进来个小个子吗?
Room for a little 'un?

391
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,950
Humphrey 你觉得发表声明怎么样?
Do you think it's good idea to issue a statement?

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
其实 大臣 具体而言
Well, Minister, in practical terms

393
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,999
我们有六种通常可用的选择
we have the usual six options.

394
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,000
其一 听之任之
One, do nothing.

395
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,700
其二 发表声明 对演说表示遗憾
Two, issue a statement deploring the speech.

396
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,169
其三 提出正式抗议
Three, lodge an official protest.

397
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,900
其四 停止援助
Four, cut off aid.

398
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,640
其五 断绝外交关系
Five, break off diplomatic relations.

399
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,700
-最后 宣战  -那该选哪个?
- And six, declare war. - Which should we do?

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,798
要是听之任之 就等于默认了演讲内容
If we do nothing, we implicitly agree with the speech.

401
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
第二 如果发表声明 我们就会出丑
Two, if we issue a statement, we will just look foolish.

402
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,000
第三 如果我们提出抗议 他们不会放在眼里
Three, if we lodge a protest, it will be ignored.

403
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,080
第四 我们无法停止援助 因为我们没援助过
Four, we can't cut off aid because we don't give them any.

404
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
第五 要是断绝外交关系
Five, if we break off diplomatic relations

405
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,860
就谈不成钻井合同了
we can't negotiate the oil rig contracts.

406
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,000
最后 如果向他们宣战
And six, if we declare war,

407
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,370
那就显得有些反应过火了
it might just look as if we were overreacting.

408
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,100
-要是在过去 就该派炮艇了 -是啊
- In the old days we'd just send in a gun boat. - Oh yes.

409
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,117
我想 这是绝对办不到的?
I suppose that IS absolutely out of the question?

410
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,200
-请进?  -大臣...
- Yes? - Minister...

411
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,000
是常务外交次长
The Permanent UnderSecretary of the Foreign Office

412
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
正沿着车厢走过来
is coming down the corridor over there

413
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
这里就要变成Calcutta的黑牢了
It'll be like the Black Hole of Calcutta.

414
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,860
-可以进来吗 大臣  -你试试吧
- May I come in, Minister. - You can try.

415
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,000
这就是我们要的一切
This is all we needed.

416
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,769
欢迎来到“站着的”委员会  (原意是常务委员会)
Welcome to the Standing Committee.

417
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
Frederick爵士 看过这爆炸性的演讲稿了吧?
Sir Frederick, you see this bomb-able speech?

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
我们该怎么办?
what are we going to do about this?

419
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,000
其实 大臣 外长...
Well, Minister, Foreign Secretary...

420
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,148
我觉得...
I think...

421
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,636
我觉得我们知道这是出于什么原因
I think we know what's behind it,

422
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,472
对吧 小汉?
don't we, Humpy?

423
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,159
小汉?
Humpy?

424
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,220
我想Frederick爵士的意思
I think Sir Frederick is suggesting

425
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,480
是这段讨厌的内容其实
that the offending paragraph may be

426
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,400
可以说 是他们讨价还价的本钱
Shall we say, a bargaining counter.

427
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,000
你是说他有所企图?
You mean he wants something?

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
否则提前把复印稿给我们干吗?
Well, if he doesn't why send us an advance copy?

429
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,150
明白了 那就弄清楚他想要什么?
See. Why don't you find out what it is he wants?

430
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,920
大使馆都是新手 我们也才刚拿到这份演说稿
The Embassy staffs are all new, we've just seen the speech.

431
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,100
又没有人对这位总统有所了解
And no one knows anything about this President.

432
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,200
除了我
Except me.

433
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,000
-除了你 怎么会?  -他们是大学同学
- Except you? How? - They were at a University together.

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,100
-老同学关系啊  -那是二十五年前的事了
- The old boy network. - That was 25 years ago.

435
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,860
他可能都不记得我了... 我觉得我真不行...
He may not even remember me... I don't really think I could...

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,888
我觉得你该去见他 Frederick
I think you ought to see him, Frederick.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
不 大臣 我觉得您份量更重
No, Minister. I think you carry more weight.

438
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,400
那好 我们就都同意
Well, we are all agreed then

439
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
该让这座大山去见Mohammed?
that the mountain shall go to Mohammed?

440
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
不 不 不 Jim去
No. No. No. Jim's going.

441
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
我就是此意
That's what I meant.

442
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,000
好吧 但你得和我一块儿去
All right, but you'll have to come with me.

443
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,890
当然了 大臣
Of course, Minister.

444
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,352
我是不会让您一个人上的
I'd hardly let you do it on your own.

445
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,000
Jim 快进来
Oh, Jim, come in.

446
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,300
-真高兴能再见到你  -Charlie... 好久不见
- How nice to see you again. - Charlie... Long time no see.

447
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,200
你可不用跟我讲洋泾浜英语 Jim
You don't have to speak pidgin English to me, Jim

448
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,800
这位是我的常务次长 Humphrey·Appleby爵士
This is Sir Humphrey Appleby, my Permanent UnderSecretary.

449
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,948
-阁下  -你好
- Your Excellency. - How do you do.

450
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,900
坐吧
Do sit down.

451
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,500
我一直以为常务次长
I've always thought that Permanent UnderSecretary

452
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,000
是个低三下四的头衔
is such a demeaning title.

453
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,918
您说什么?
I beg your pardon?

454
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,880
听起来就像个助理打字员之流
Sounds like an Assistant Typist or something,

455
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,460
其实你掌管一切 是吗?
whereas you're really in charge of everything, aren't you?

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
其实 也不是一切
Well, not quite everything.

457
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,190
Charlie 我要祝贺你
Charlie, I suppose I should congratulate you

458
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,650
成为了一位国家首领
on becoming a Head of State.

459
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,790
谢谢 这不难
Oh, thanks. It wasn't difficult.

460
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,850
我用不着去做什么烦琐的事 比如竞选
I didn't have to do any of the boring things, like fighting elections

461
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,860
或是补缺选举之类
or by-elections.

462
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,850
Jim 我当然很高兴见到你
Jim, of course I'm delighted to see you,

463
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,554
不过你这次来只是想叙叙旧
but is this purely a social visit,

464
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:47,880
还是有什么特别的事要谈?
or is there anything in particular you wanted to talk about?

465
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,820
我还得花时间最后再润色一下演讲稿
Because I do have to put a finish in touches of my speech.

466
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,660
是的... 实际上 我们看了稿子复印件
Ah... Well, yes... Actually, we have seen an advanced copy...

467
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,719
喜欢吗?
You liked it?

468
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,200
Charlie 我就开门见山吧?
Charlie, may I speak frankly?

469
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,210
-我们是老朋友了 对吧?  -当然
- I mean we're old friends, aren't we? - Of course.

470
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,700
你一定明白那段讲殖民压迫的
You must realise that that bit about colonialist oppression

471
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,600
有那么一点... 非常...
was a bit... well... um, very...

472
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,018
其实 十分之令人尴尬
Well, actually profoundly embarrassing.

473
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,800
你那段催促苏格兰人和爱尔兰人...
That passage where you urged the Scots and the Irish to er...

474
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,060
我想是不是可以... 省略掉?
I wonder if you could um, give it a miss?

475
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,136
-省略掉?  -是的
- Give it a miss? - Yes.

476
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,300
但是 我深深地感到这是如此真实
But, this is something I feel very, very deeply to be true.

477
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,400
相信贵国政府不会压制真相吧?
Surely the British don't believe in suppressing the truth?

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
当然不会
Good heavens no.

479
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,200
总统阁下 我想是否有办法说服您
I wonder if there's anything that might persuade you, President.

480
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,100
改变一下措辞 将其重点
to consider recasting that sentence and transfering the emphasis

481
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,900
从具体的事例 转移到抽象的概念上去
from the specific instance to the abstract concept

482
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
当然了 不管怎样 又不至于
without, of course, in any way,

483
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,850
削弱演讲主题概念上的完整性
impairing the conceptual integrity of the theme.

484
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,500
是啊...
Yes...

485
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,050
我能先说点别的吗?
May I change the subject?

486
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,020
Jim 既然你来了 是否可以先向你
Jim, while you're here may I sound you out on a proposal

487
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,200
征求一下我打算给首相提的建议?
I was going to make to the Prime Minister?

488
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
什么建议?
What proposal?

489
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,100
这次政府的小变化给我们石油工业的
Our little change of Government has quite unnecessarily alarmed

490
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,800
一些投资者造成了不必要的恐慌
some of the investors in our oil industry.

491
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,200
当然只是暂时的 不过我们的确需要
Only temporarily of course, but it does mean that we need

492
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
一点英国投资帮我们渡过难关
a little British investment to tide us over.

493
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,890
来恢复信心 这你明白
To restore confidence, you know.

494
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,000
要多少?
How much?

495
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
五千万英镑
Fifty million pounds.

496
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
问问他还款期限
Ask him on what terms.

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,897
还款期限呢?
On what terms?

498
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:36,900
十年后开始偿还本金
Repayment of the capital not to start before ten years.

499
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,150
并且免利息
And interest free.

500
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,000
五千万英镑... 可是一笔巨款
Fifty million pounds... it's a lot of money.

501
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,518
我明白了 那样的话...
I see, well in that case...

502
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,400
但这并不意味我们不能谈谈? 嗨 Humphrey
But that doesn't mean we can't talk about it? Hey, Humphrey

503
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,480
免利息? 十年?
Interest free? Ten years?

504
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,200
假定利率是百分之十
Assuming that the interest would be a 10%

505
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,800
他要我们白白送给他五千万英镑
he's asking for a free gift of fifty million pounds.

506
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,860
这么看来你似乎是要
It would appear that you're rightly asking for

507
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,800
我们白送五千万英镑
is a free gift of about fifty million pounds.

508
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
但这对你们有利
But it's to your advantage.

509
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,000
我们会用贷款去买Clyde造的钻井
We would use the loan to buy oil rigs built on the Clyde.

510
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,478
这样...
Ah, well.

511
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,200
他要我们给他五千万英镑
He's asking us to give him 50 million pounds

512
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,509
然后用我们的钱买我们的钻井
so that he can buy our oil rigs with our money.

513
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,710
我觉得还算合理
Reasonable to me.

514
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,300
-合理 大臣?  -会创造很多工作 Humphrey
- Reasonable, Minister? - Lots of jobs, Humphrey.

515
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,800
Charlie 要是这笔交易做成了
Charlie, supposing it were possible to do this deal,

516
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,780
你是不是有可能会对
would you find it possible to make the

517
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,000
演讲内容做些必要的删减?
necessary cuts in your speech today?

518
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,100
是的 但现在就得定下来
Yes, but I'd have to know now.

519
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,850
真黑!(谐音Black male)
Blackmail!

520
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,880
你是在说我还是我的建议?
Are you describing me or my proposal?

521
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,050
当然是你的建议
Your proposal, naturally.

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,900
不 不 也不是你的建议
No, no, not even your proposal.

523
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,610
我想可以达成协议了 是吗 Humphrey?
I think we can come to agreement, don't you, Humphrey?

524
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,479
大臣...
Minister...

525
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,031
能和你说几句吗?
Could I have a word with you?

526
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,599
什么?
Yes?

527
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,434
请原谅 阁下
Will you excuse us, Your Excellency?

528
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
-有什么不妥吗?  -有什么妥当吗?
- Is anything wrong? - Is anything right?

529
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,050
他给了我们出路
He's offering us a way out.

530
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,100
出路? 要我们白送五千万 出路?
A way out? He's calling us to give a gift of 50mp. A way out?

531
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,000
-是贷款  -随你怎么说 这可永远也要不回来了
- It's a loan. - You call it what you like. We'll never get it back.

532
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,300
你打算花掉整整五千万公款
You're proposing to buy your way out of political involvement

533
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,400
来买条政治上的出路?
with fifty million pounds of public money?

534
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
-这就是外交  -这是腐败 大臣
- It's diplomacy. - It's corruption, Minister.

535
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,600
高级英帝国勋爵
K.B.E.

536
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,000
小汉
Humpy.

537
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,879
你的意思是...
You mean...

538
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,860
是的 我明白了
Yes, I see.

539
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,980
我想我们也不希望苏联人投资Buranda 是吧?
I suppose we don't want the Soviets to invest in Buranda, do we?

540
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,833
而且不可否认的是
And I suppose it could be argued that

541
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,000
我们应该负起责任来 尤其是对...
we have a responsibility to the...

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
非洲弹丸小国
T.P.L.A.C.'s.

543
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,200
是的 非常正确
Yes, quite.

544
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,400
好吧
Oh, good.

545
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,780
总统先生 我想我们可以达成协议了
Mr. President, I think we can come to terms after all.

546
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,200
-好吧 你知道我的价格  -你也知道我的
