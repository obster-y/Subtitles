节约运动


5
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,189
看过了?
You've read it?

6
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,017
看了
I've read it.

7
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,034
看这个了吗?
Have you read this?

8
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:50,950
他看了
He's read it.

9
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,000
我念给你听
Let me read it to you!

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,213
我们看过了
We've read it.

11
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:54,800
“把Jim·Hacker辞退”
"Let's get rid of Jim Hacker",

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,360
特别调查员John·Pilgrim撰稿
by John Pilgrim special investigator.

13
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,675
Jim·Hacker议员阁下
The Right Honourable Jim Jacker MP,

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,606
曾承诺履行政府提出的
promised to carry out the government's plans

15
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:02,968
精简行政机构的计划
to slim down the Civil Service, listen,

16
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:05,025
清除来自白厅及市政厅
to wipe out the interference from the WhiteHall and

17
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,418
好事之人的干扰
Town Hall busybodies.

18
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:09,256
但有多少人意识到 调查表明毫无进展
But how many people realise that the detectives want a example

19
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,007
在国内税收部门工作的人
more people serve in the Inland Revenue

20
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,500
甚至比在皇家海军服役的人还多?
than the Royal Navy?

21
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:14,443
-真的吗?  -确有其事 大臣
- Is it true? - I believe it is, Minister.

22
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:15,889
“也许政府认为
"Perhaps the government thinks

23
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:18,637
-征税才是最佳的国防”  -还挺幽默的
- that a tax is the best form of defence". - Oh that's rather witty.

24
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:23,325
-这段你看过了吗?  -看过了
- And have you read this bit? - I have read it.

25
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,952
“我发现至少有四个部门
"I have discovered that no less than four ministries

26
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,259
负责检查同一种陆军制服的供给情况
check the supply of the same army uniforms.

27
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,116
国防部检查是否收到了所订货物
The Ministry Defence checks to see they get what they ordered.

28
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,165
而工业部检查
But the Department of Industry

29
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:33,637
这些服装是否
checks to see they have been manufactured

30
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,246
按照政府规定的标准生产
according to government regulations.

31
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,648
财政部检查款项 而Jim·Hacker那伙人
The Treasury checks the bills. And Jim Hacker's mob

32
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,467
只是监督其他所有人
just checks up on everyone else.

33
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:42,145
Jim·Hacker本人就是白厅冗员繁多
Jim Hacker is the most obvious case

34
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,353
最明显的例子
of overmanning in WhiteHall.

35
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,629
让我们首先把他辞退 至少可以省下一份薪水”
Let's start by getting rid of him and save at least one salary".

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,827
Frank 干吗要念给我听 我告诉你我看过了
Frank, why did you read me that? I told you I'd read it.

37
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:55,499
因为我是你的政治顾问
Because I'm your political advisor.

38
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,867
你有没有意识到 这在政治上会有多大的破坏性
Do you realise how politically damaging for you.

39
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,002
早上好 大臣
Good morning, Minister.

40
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,000
你看了吗?
Have you read this?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,917
看了! 看了! 看了!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

42
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,669
我看过了! 我看过了
I have read it! I have read it,

43
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,136
你看过了 他也看过了
You have read it, he has read it!

44
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,759
我们都他妈看过了
We have all bloody read it,

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,337
我说得还不清楚吗?
do I make myself clear?

46
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,073
再清楚不过了 大臣
Abundantly, Minister.

47
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,426
很抱歉 坐
I'm sorry. Sit down.

48
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,992
Humphrey 我们必须精简公务员
Humphrey, we have got to slim down the Civil Service.

49
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,840
我们部门里有多少人?
Howmany people have we got in this department?

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,930
这个部门吗? 哦 我们部很小的
This department? Oh, we're very small.

51
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,298
小? 有多小?
Small? How small?

52
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,291
-不知道...  -2千人?
- I don't know... - 2,000?

53
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,975
3千?
3,000?

54
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:36,444
我想 大概2万3千人吧 大臣
about 23,000 I think, Minister.

55
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,806
2万3千人?
23,000?

56
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,099
在行政部?
In the Department of Administrative Affairs?

57
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,435
这2万3千人都在管理其他行政人员?
23,000 people just administering other administrators?

58
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,532
我们得研究一下体制和工作方法 看看哪些是冗员
We'll have to do a study to see who we can get rid of.

59
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,848
-去年我们倒是研究过 大臣阁下  -结果呢?
- We did one of those last year, minister. - And?

60
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:52,276
结果表明我们还需要再增加五百人
It transpired we needed another 500 people.

61
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,850
不过 大臣阁下 我们可以关闭
However minister, we could always close

62
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,784
你那个政府部门监察办公室
your Bureaucratic Watchdog Office.

63
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,449
这可不行 这才刚刚成立
No, you don't. The office just opened.

64
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,491
这可是我上任以来做的唯一事情
It's the one thing I've done since I got here.

65
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,634
随便您 大臣 不过那早已为人诟病
But as you wish minster, it has been criticised

66
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:07,049
-被称作好事者的信箱  -我知道
- as a trouble makers' letterbox. - I know.

67
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,750
不过 在选民中倒很受欢迎 Humphrey
It's very popular with the voters Humphrey

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,585
这能让我们找到方法
This is a chance to help us find ways

69
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:12,788
杜绝浪费政府资金
to stop wasting government money.

70
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:14,340
但是公众对如何挥霍
But public doesn't know anthing about wasting

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,216
公家的钱财可是一窍不通 我们才是专家
government money. We are the experts.

72
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:19,126
我可不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

73
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:22,822
总之 监察办公室要保留下来
Well, the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office stays.

74
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,710
这样的话 我一时也想不出什么建议了
Well, offhand I can't think of what else to suggest.

75
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,435
你是在认真地跟我说
Are you seriously telling me that

76
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,481
我们没有办法精简人员吗?
there is no way we can cut down?

77
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:33,151
我想我们可以裁掉一两个端茶小姐
I suppose we could lose one or two of the tea ladies.

78
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:34,961
别闹了 Humphrey
Oh, Humphrey,

79
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,124
我确实希望你能端正下态度
I do wish you'd take this seriously.

80
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:39,706
端茶小姐! 我要的是事实
Tea ladies! I want the facts.

81
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,981
我要知道谁在这儿工作 都干些什么工作
I want to know who works here, what they do,

82
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,906
我们有哪些楼 里面的人都在干什么
what buildings we have, what goes on in them.

83
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:45,405
完整的记录
And complete record.

84
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:47,148
然后就能知道哪儿该节省开支
Then we'll know where to cut costs,

85
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,435
裁减人员 简化程序了
cut staff, cut procedures...

86
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,018
大臣 行政部门
The Civil Service, Minister,

87
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:54,260
就是为了贯彻议会颁布的法律而存在的
exists to implement legislation enacted by Parliament.

88
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,300
只要议会还在立法
As long as Parliament continues to legislate,

89
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,191
行政机构...
the Civil Service...

90
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,705
不过 我完全理解您的要求 大臣
However, I am fully seized of your requirements, minister.

91
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,318
请允许我这就去让轮子转起来
and if you excuse me I'll go and set the wheels in motion.

92
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:05,403
谢谢
Thank you.

93
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,829
早上好 Weasel先生
Good morning, Mr. Weasel.

94
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,117
Weisel
Weisel.

95
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,163
你知道吗 一个西北地区区长
Did you know that a northwest Regional Controller

96
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:17,856
仅在他的区域就削减了三千两百万英镑的开支
has achieved cuts of 32 million pounds in his region alone?

97
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,825
而行政机构却把这消息给压了下去
And that the Civil Service is suppressing the whole story?

98
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,755
-真的吗?  -要是真的 就太震惊了
- Is it true? - Well if it is, I'm aghast!

99
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:24,818
为什么要压制消息?
Why does it suppress news?

100
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,091
因为连他都做得到的话 那别人也不得不节约了
Because if he can save money, everyone else will have to do it.

101
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:31,358
你何不调查一下
Why don't you look into it,

102
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,400
做个雪貂 四处打探(ferret本意雪貂，引申为打探)
have a bit of a ferret around?

103
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:37,495
你觉得我可以吗?
Do you think I could?

104
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,578
我觉得主意不错
I think that's a very good idea,

105
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,625
-雪貂 哦不对 Wea…Weisel先生  -嘿！
- Mr. Ferret, er, Weasel. - Hey!

106
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:45,559
他告诉你是三千二百万英镑?
He told you 32 million pounds?

107
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,033
-是的 Humphrey爵士  -太震惊了
- Yes, Sir Humphrey. - I'm aghast!

108
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:47,774
我也是
So was I.

109
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:49,732
我们居然不知道 太不可思议了
It's incredible we didn't know about it.

110
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,488
我早就知道了
I knew about it.

111
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,512
那你为什么震惊?
Then why are you aghast?

112
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,203
我震惊是因为消息泄漏了
I'm aghast that it got out.

113
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,791
明年或许财政部不会给我们那么多钱了
We might get less money from the Treasury next year.

114
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,965
哦 五点半已经过了 来杯雪利酒?
Oh, it's after half past five. Sherry?

115
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,615
呃 嗯 好的 谢谢
Oh, er, yes. Thank you.

116
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,400
你看起来还是很担心 Bernard
You still look worried, Bernard.

117
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,598
嗯 是的
Well... yes.

118
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,425
我的意思是 当然我们想要省钱
I mean, surely we want to save money.

119
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,792
Bernard 你很清楚
Bernard, You know perfectly well

120
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:10,925
政府部门必定要有
there has to be some way

121
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:14,045
某种衡量其成就的方法
to measure success in the Civil Service.

122
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:17,212
英国利兰公司以他们的利润
British Leyland measure their success

123
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,026
来衡量成就
by the size of their profits,

124
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,268
或者 更准确地说
or, to be more accurate,

125
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:22,886
他们是以自己的损失来衡量失败
they measure their failure by the size of their losses.

126
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,591
我们没有利润 也没有损失
We don't have profits and losses.

127
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,017
我们的成就是靠
We have to measure our success

128
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,586
雇员人数和预算的多少来衡量的
by the size of our staff and our budget.

129
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,847
明白地说 Bernard
By definition, Bernard,

130
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,667
庞大的部门比小部门更有成就
a big department is more successful than a small one.

131
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,631
你是不是说那名西北地区区长
Are you saying that the northwest Regional Controller

132
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,587
省下那么多钱是在做傻事?
boobed by saving so much money?

133
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,188
哦 当然 谁也没让他这么做
Well, of course. Nobody asked him to.

134
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:44,803
要是人人都如此
Suppose everybody did it!

135
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,307
要是所有人都开始
Suppose everyone went around saving money

136
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,285
不负责任地到处省钱
irresponsibly all over the place.

137
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:51,722
大臣正有此意 不是吗?
That's what the Minister wants, isn't it?

138
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,507
坐下 Bernard
Do sit down, Bernard.

139
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:58,703
大臣们就像走马灯更换无常
Ministers come and Ministers go.

140
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,054
任何部门的大臣
The average Minister lasts less

141
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:02,978
平均任期都不到十一个月
than 11 months in any department.

142
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,252
听着 Bernard 我们责无旁贷地
You see, Bernard, it is our duty

143
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:09,367
应协助大臣争取部门经费
to assist the Minister to fight for the Department's money

144
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,202
即便他自己担惊受怕
despite his own panic reactions.

145
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,388
你是说帮他克服恐慌
You mean help him overcome his panic.

146
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,922
不 不 不
No. No. No.

147
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,740
我们任他惊慌失措
No, we must let him panic.

148
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:19,589
政治家乐意惊惶失措 他们需要活动
Politicians like to panic. They need activity.

149
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,710
以此代替成就
It's their substitute for achievement.

150
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,366
我们必须确保一切照旧
We must just ensure that it doesn't change anything.

151
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,989
可他们是民众的代表
But even so they are the people's representatives,

152
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,382
是民主选举的结果
democratically chosen.

153
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,111
议员并非人民的选择
MP's aren't chosen by the people,

154
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,966
而是其所在地党派决定的
they are chosen by their local party.

155
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,135
是由35个穿着邋遢雨衣的男人
35 men in grubby raincoats

156
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,059
或是35个戴着愚蠢礼帽的女人
or 35 women in silly hats.

157
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:44,573
可内阁成员来自他们中最优秀的人
And the government are selected from the best of them.

158
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:45,725
Bernard
Bernard,

159
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,735
下院议员仅有630位
there are only 630 MP's.

160
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,368
一个党派超过300名席位便组成内阁
If one party has just over 300 it forms a government.

161
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:55,831
这300人中 有100名又老又蠢
Of that 300, one hundred are too old and too silly,

162
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,040
还有100名又稚又嫩
one hundred too young and too callow

163
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,641
剩下的大约100名下院议员
which leaves just about a hundred MP's

164
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,765
便填上了100个政府职务
to fill 100 governmental posts.

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,122
根本无从挑选
There's no choice at all.

166
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,733
他们未经甄别 未受训练
They've had no selection, no training.

167
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,729
我们不得不为他们代劳
We have to do the job for them.

168
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,145
但节省3千2百万开支的事
But how can we explain saving 32 million pounds

169
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:16,145
如何向大臣解释?
to the Minister?

170
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,286
我们可以声称
Well, We can explain they've changed

171
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:20,286
西北的账目体系有了改变
their accounting systems in the northwest.

172
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,184
或者各区的管辖范围经过重新划分
Or that they've redrawn the regional boundaries

173
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:26,116
现在的数据已经没有意义了
so that the current figures aren't operable.

174
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,051
一切皆有可能
There are all sorts of possibilities.

175
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:30,838
明白了
I see.

176
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:33,799
有益的交谈 Bernard
Useful chat, Bernard,

177
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:36,543
记住这从未发生过
good job it never took place.

178
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,918
是的 当然没有
Yes. Yes. Of course.

179
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:42,283
我们的朋友Weasel上哪去了?
So what else is our friend Weasel up to?

180
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:43,794
他在当雪貂
Oh, he's ferretting.

181
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,885
当雪貂? 哪儿?
Ferretting? Where?

182
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,244
四处打探
It's a roving brief.

183
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,895
看来我们不得不给侦查员安排辆政府用车了
Then we shall have to provide Rover with a government car.

184
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:56,115
便于了解他在哪儿打洞了
So that we'll know where he's digging.

185
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,094
你…
How...

186
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,649
你是如何和谐你的大臣的 小汉?
how are you getting on with your Minister, Humpy?

187
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,496
还没把那节约的事控制住?
Got this economising nonsense under control?

188
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,614
是的 控制住了 巨人 或多或少
Yes, I think so, Jumbo... more or less.

189
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:09,500
“或多或少”什么意思?
What do you mean more or less?

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,885
好吧 既是又不是
Well... yes and no.

191
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:15,103
大概与所有其他的政府节约一样吧?
Presumably it's like all the other government economy drives?

192
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:18,563
三天的新闻发布 三周的内阁备忘录
Three days of press releases, three weeks of ministerial's memos,

193
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:20,518
中东发生危机 一切恢复正常?
a crisis in the Middle East and back to normal again?

194
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,008
这次稍有不同
Well this one's slightly different.

195
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,175
他想他是要把
I'm afraid He's beginning to see

196
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:27,359
裁员视为其首要任务了
slimming down the Service as his main task.

197
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,717
该死的 我们无须瘦身!
Dammit, we don't need slimming!

198
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,307
我想你或许应该
I think you might have to conduct

199
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,448
再来一个“自讨苦吃行动”
another Operation Hair Shirt.

200
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,559
自讨苦吃行动
Operation Hair Shirt.

201
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,180
明智的主意
What a good idea.

202
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,709
引领他感受痛苦的个人节约
Guide him towards painful personal economies.

203
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,754
就是这样 你知道
Yes, you know.

204
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:50,875
“节约应从‘我’做起 大臣阁下”
"Economy begins at home, Minister".

205
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,837
“要树立表率 大臣阁下”
"Set an example, Minister".

206
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:56,354
“我们必须身体力行才能令人信服 大臣阁下”
"Can't expect others to do what we can't do ourselves, Minister".

207
00:08:56,354 --> 00:09:00,476
对极了 这正是他需要的 自我否定
Yes, yes. Just what he needs, self denial.

208
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,407
了不起
Splendid.

209
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:08,692
好 第3项 节约运动
Right. Item 3. The economy drive.

210
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,033
有关我们的铺张浪费 Frank 提供了
Frank has come up with some really startling indications

211
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,781
一些让人震惊的信息
of wastage in our very midst.

212
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:14,877
他核实过了?
Has he confirmed?

213
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,400
我想我揭露的事实准会让你大吃一惊的
And I think you gonna be pretty surprised of what I uncovered

214
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,651
我得说 Humphrey
And I must say Hamphrey

215
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,541
这些事实看来是对
These facts are a frightening indictment

216
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,730
官僚作风与自我放纵的可怕谴责
of bureaucratic sloppiness and self indulgence.

217
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,618
天哪 天哪
Dear, yeah.

218
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:24,825
但如你所见
But as you'll see,

219
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,056
这倒是给我们提供了巨大的空间
they do give us enormous scope

220
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:29,177
来大刀阔斧地开展节约运动
for some really dramatic economies.

221
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:30,620
令人期待!
Good show!

222
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:35,726
两份报告 一份关于人力资源 一份办公楼
Two files, one on manpower, one on buildings.

223
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,890
从办公楼开始吧
Let's start with the buildings.

224
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,680
Chadwick大厦 西Audley街
Chadwick House, West Audley Street.

225
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,967
巨大的建筑 但办公的人却寥寥无几
A huge building only a handful of people working there.

226
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:44,559
是啊 20人
Yes, 20...

227
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,355
抱歉 我恰好清楚Chadwick大厦的情况
I'm so sorry. I do happen to know about Chadwick House.

228
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,496
你了解些什么?
What do you know?

229
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:50,144
很显然并未充分利用
It's obviously underused at the most,

230
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:51,400
但它已被指定为
but it's the destinite office

231
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,716
新成立的环境署办公楼
for the new Commission for the Environment.

232
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,040
我们还说不准它是否
And we're actually wondering

233
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,772
足够容纳所有的工作人员
if it's going to be big enough for all the staff.

234
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,240
好吧
O.K.

235
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,135
那么位于Walthamstow的Ladysmith大厦呢?
What about Ladysmith Buildings, Walthamstow.

236
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,500
-那可是完全空着  -理应如此
- Apparently that's empty. - Of course.

237
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,678
你的“理应如此”的意思是?
What do you mean, of course?

238
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,504
出于安全考虑 大臣 我不能多言
Security, minister. I can say no more.

239
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,000
你是指军情六处?
Do you mean MI6?

240
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,000
这又是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,959
我们不承认有军情六处这回事
We do not admit that MI6 exists.

242
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,100
谁不知道它的存在
Everybody knows it exists.

243
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,960
即便如此 我们不能承认
Nevertheless, we do not admit it.

244
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,375
这桌子旁坐着的人并非都是经过检疫的
Not everyone round this table has been vetted.

245
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,111
对猫才用“检疫”这个词吧
I thought that was something you do cats.

246
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,606
确实如此 对“雪貂”就不用 大臣阁下
Yes, indeed. But not ferrets, Minister.

247
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,177
Ladysmith大厦是最高机密
Ladysmith House is top secret.

248
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,864
Walthamstow上七层的大厦怎么会是最高机密?
How can a seven-storey building in Walthamstow to be top secret?

249
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,465
有志者事竟成
Where there's a will there's a way.

250
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,655
那Wellington大厦和Westminster旧厅呢?
What about Wellington House and Westminster Old Hall?

251
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,126
Wellington大厦 位于Hyde公园大道
Wellington House, Hyde Park Road,

252
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,762
价值七百五十万英镑
estimated value 7.5 million pounds.

253
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,790
Westminster旧厅 位于Sackville广场
Westminster Old Hall, Sackville Square,

254
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,349
价值一千一百万英镑
estimated value 11 million pounds.

255
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,887
两幢办公楼里的员工都不多
Each building with a tiny staff,

256
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:07,920
却都摆满了档案柜
and both filled apparently entirely with filing cabinets.

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,386
请问这些估价的根据是?
May I ask the source of these valuations?

258
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,132
办公用房的市价
Going rate for office property in the end.

259
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:14,938
但它们没一个能卖到这个现行价格
But neither of these properties would fetch the going rate.

260
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:15,606
为什么不能?
Why not?

261
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,041
Wellington大厦既没有防火梯 也没有防火门
Wellington House has no fire escape or fire doors

262
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,753
而大厦的构造也不容改建
and the fabric of building wouldn't stand the alteration.

263
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,220
不能当作办公楼
so it can't be used as offices.

264
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,790
-那你是如何用上这幢大厦的?  -是啊
- How are you able to use them? - Yeah?

265
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,978
政府办公楼无须防火安全通道
Government buildings do not require fire safety clearance.

266
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:28,386
为何不用?
Why not?

267
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:31,990
可能是女王陛下的公仆们
Well, perhaps because Her Majesty's Civil Servants

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,869
不易着火吧
are not easily inflamed.

269
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,795
希望如此
I hope it is right.

270
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,006
那Westminster旧厅呢?
What about Westminster Old Hall?

271
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,876
一级保护建筑
Class one Registered Building.

272
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,338
不能改变当前房屋使用人
Can't change current user designation.

273
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,734
好吧 Beaconsfield街上的3到17号大楼呢?
I see. 3 to 17 Beaconsfield Street?

274
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,044
对 是了 该建筑现在有了三层的
Ah, yes. Now that has a three-level

275
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,559
钢筋混凝土地下室
reinforced concrete basement.

276
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:56,093
这又怎么了?
So?

277
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:58,056
防范未然
It is there in case.

278
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:59,875
未然什么?
In case?

279
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:01,725
要知道 大臣阁下
Well, you know, Minister.

280
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,397
政府应急总部所在地 以防万一
Emergency Government Headquarters, if and when.

281
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:05,274
万一怎么了?
If and when what?

282
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:09,582
万一... 你明白的
If and when... you know what.

283
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,621
什么?
What?

284
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:13,120
你明白的那个万一
If and when you know what.

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,802
我不明白 是什么?
I don't know what. What?

286
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:15,929
什么
What?

287
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:17,666
你那句“你明白的那个万一”是什么意思?
What do you mean, if and when you know what?

288
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,529
大臣 万一危机来临
Minister, when the chips are down,

289
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,953
局势动荡 吹灯拔蜡…
and the balloons are up and the lights go out...

290
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:26,482
政府也得有个地方继续运行啊
There has to be somewhere to carry on government,

291
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,663
即便一切都陷入瘫痪
even if everything else stops.

292
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:30,373
为什么?
Why?

293
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
难道国家分崩离析了
The government just stops just because

294
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,888
内阁就该偃旗息鼓吗?
the whole country's been destroyed.

295
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,526
毁于一旦已经够糟了
Annihilation's bad enough,

296
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,999
无政府状态只会雪上加霜
without anarchy to make things even worse.

297
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,890
你以为尚有许多反叛的余孽?
you mean a lot of rebellions cinders?

298
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,048
没错
That's right.

299
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,659
到那时你还指望管理谁?
Who would be there for you to govern?

300
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,902
肯定还会有些普通民众
Well, abound to be some ordinary people around.

301
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,220
那中央户籍登记处的那幢楼呢?
What about central registry?

302
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,680
没有建筑许可
No planning permission.

303
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,320
他怎么什么都知道?
How did he know all these?

304
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,043
你早就知道我去哪儿了?
You knew where I'd been.

305
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,930
我们当然知道他何去何从
Obviously we knew where he'd been.

306
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,580
难不成他本该暗中打探吗?
Why, was he supposed to be spying?

307
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,518
我们信奉公开调查 不是吗?
We do believe in open enquiries, don't we?

308
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,092
我们看看人力资源方面
Let us turn to manpower.

309
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,431
对 我们看看
Yes, let's!

310
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:16,691
在Sunderland就有90名公务员
Aparently there are 90 Civil Servants

311
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,726
明显在重复白厅这儿
in Sunderland except the duplicating the work

312
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,238
另外90个人从事的工作
of 90 more here in WhiteHall.

313
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,698
这源于内阁的一项决定
That stems from a Cabinet decision,

314
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:25,493
-为东北地区创造就业机会  -把这些人裁了吧
- job creation in the northeast. - Well let's get rid of them.

315
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:28,065
对 一下子就裁掉了90名公务员
Yes, we'd get rid of 90 Civil Servants at a stroke.

316
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:31,624
-是啊 或是一下子就引起了一场罢工  -对 什么?
- Yes, or indeed, at a strike. - Yes. What?

317
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,407
个人而言 我完全
Well, personally I would be whole heartily

318
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:36,165
赞成这个行动 大臣阁下
in favour of such a move, minister.

319
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,639
这会是一场辉煌的节约运动
It would be a splendid economy.

320
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,557
在一个萧条的边缘选区裁员
And show great political courage to sack staff

321
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:44,693
会展现出极大的政治魄力
in depressed marginal constituencies.

322
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,520
我就是不信
I just don't believe it that

323
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,410
没有可节约之处 浪费明明随处可见
There is nowhere we can cut down. I see waste everywhere.

324
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,680
我同意您的话 大臣阁下
Well I agree with you, Minister.

325
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,040
确有可节约之处
There's certain diseconomy

326
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,082
好吧 哪儿?
Well, where?

327
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,300
我有时会觉得恰恰是
Well. I sometimes feel that the very way

328
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,987
我们的行事排场太过奢侈
we do things is on too lavish a scale.

329
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,767
您知道 汽车 办公器材
You know, cars, furnishings...

330
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:06,248
娱乐设备 私人办公人员 复印机…
entertainments, private office staff, duplicating machines...

331
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,975
对 对 对 好极了
Yes. Yes. Yes. Fine. Yes.

332
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:10,080
我们就从这下手 这可太妙了
That's where we'll start. Magnificent.

333
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,622
-不过 这里还有个问题  -我就知道
- Yes, unfortunely there is a difficulty. - I knew it!

334
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:15,034
是啊 如果上头的人还继续享受
Yes, it does cause profound resentment

335
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,000
各种便利和舒适
if those at the top continue to enjoy

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,509
却不让下面的人分享
the comforts, the conveniences,

337
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,464
势必会引起强烈的不满
they withdraw from those below them,

338
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,130
更不必说公众舆论导致的可怕后果
not to mention the deeply damaging publicity...

339
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,555
你是说我和你应该…
You mean you and I should...

340
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,320
以身作则?
Set a personal example?

341
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,289
节约应从“我”做起?
Economy begins at home?

342
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,549
我们必须身体力行
We can't expect others to do

343
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,825
才能令人信服 不是吗?
what we don't do ourselves, can we?

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
靠这个好像省不出多少吧?
Does it really save all that much?

345
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,266
当然不会直接省下来
Well, not directly, no.

346
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:43,379
但对整个政府部门的模范作用将不可限量
but as an example to the whole public service incalculable.

347
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,581
好吧 不知道...
Well, I don't know...

348
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:48,520
你想 Jim 这会产生巨大的公众效应
You know, Jim, there'd be a lot of great publicity in it:

349
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:51,154
“大臣指明了方向”
"The Minister shows the way".

350
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,556
“清廉的内阁”
"Slimline Government".

351
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,943
“哈克作出了表率”
"Hacker sets an example".

352
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:56,754
Jim号召“节约”
"Save it" says Jim.

353
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,505
对 对 就这样
Yes. Yes, that's it.

354
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,583
好极了 我们从何开始?
Great, where do we start?

355
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:09,850
-把灯...  -抱歉 你睡了?
- Turn the... - Sorry. Were you asleep?

356
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,860
是的
Yes.

357
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:13,879
我错过了火车
I missed my train.

358
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:16,192
不得不一路步行到Euston
Had to walk all the way to Euston.

359
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,127
你的那辆公家司机开的车呢?
What happen to the chauffeur driven car?

360
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:18,960
削减掉了
Got rid of it.

361
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,816
为什么?
Why?

362
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,198
连司机一起退掉了
Got rid of all the chauffeur, too.

363
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:22,750
所有豪华的办公家具
and all that grand office furniture,

364
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,711
藏酒 我私人办公室的大半人员
drinks cabinet, half the staff in my private office.

365
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,641
-你被开除了  -没有 没有
- You've been sacked. - No, no...

366
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,168
-那是为何?  -这叫节约运动
- Then why? - It's an economy drive.

367
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,662
我在作表率
I'm setting an example.

368
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:38,733
没有奢侈品 没有虚架子 没有特权
No luxuries, no frills, no privileges...

369
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,231
你疯了
You're mad...

370
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:44,277
你做了20年后座议员 一直抱怨缺东少西
For 20 years you've complained that as a backbencher you had no facilities.

371
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,483
现在一应俱全 你又统统放弃
Now you have been given them and you are throwing them away.

372
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:49,583
你20年来一直想有所成就
20 years you've wanted to be a success.

373
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,809
如果还没失败来得舒适 这又是何苦呢?
Why did you want it, if it brings no greater comfort than failure?

374
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,884
亲爱的 你不懂政治 对吧?
Honey you don't really understand politics to you.

375
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,186
长此以往 将会给我更大的权利
This way's gonna bring me much more power in the end.

376
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,665
说的不错 亲爱的 你以后当上首相
Yeah, darling. And how are you going to travel

377
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,119
打算以什么代步?
when you are Prime Minister.

378
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,337

Hitch hike?

379

00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,728
真得不行 相当紧急
Not really, it's rather urgent.

裁员后 这儿就剩我们两个了
And since the cutbacks there's just the two of us.

保持实效十分困难
it is awfully difficult to keep track.

娇生惯养的官僚树立了一个典范”
of bowler hatted bureaucrats".

449
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:13,023
太棒了 对吗?
Terrific, isn't it?

450
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,830
您已经给我读过了 大臣
Yes you have read it to me already.

451
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,885
-棒极了 对吗?  -是的 大臣阁下
- Great, isn't it? - Oh, Yes, Minister.

452
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,913
节约正在起步(on the beach还有失业之意)
Economise on the beaches...

453
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:25,990
-打扰了 -什么事?
- Excuse me. - Yes? Yes?

454
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,980
我想见大臣
I would like to see the minister.

456
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,686

00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:35,870

459
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,625
听闻裁员将涉及到我们的会员
We're very disturbed about rumours

460
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,781
我们倍感不安
of could back redundancies affecting our members...

461
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,620
抱歉 Watson先生 您不能见大臣

00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,690
下周?

469
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,116

是的 我们正等着Brough先生
Yes, we're expecting Mr. Brough now.

471
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,376
在Euston耽搁了?
When's it due in at Euston?

472
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,527
我们不得不取消今天的会面了
We'll just have to cancel it for today then.

473
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,687
好的 我会向他转达 再见

00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,925
恐怕不行 你瞧...
Oh no ,I'm afraid not, you see...

479
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,977
你能稍等片刻吗?
Would you excuse me just a moment?

480
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,842
喂? 不 他不在
Yes? No. He's not here.

481
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,424
他去上议院的组织秘书办公室了
He's gone over to the Whips' Office.

482
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,834
您需要转分机吗?
Would you like the extension?

483
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,774
您是…
Ah, Mr...

484
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,219
Brough先生?
Brough?

485
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,782
不是 Brough先生不得不取消会见
No. Mr. Brough's had to cancel the meeting.

486
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,432
我是Ron·Watson 我来...
My name's Ron Watson. I'm...

487
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:39,361
很高兴您能替他来
I'm glad you could get here instead anyway.

488
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,618
-请坐吧 好吗  -谢谢
- Do sit down, would you. - Oh, thank you.

489
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,281
好吧 恩...
Now, Mr. Er...

490
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,824
Watson
Watson.

491
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,000
Watson先生 在我们开始前
Mr. Watson, Before we start

492
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,286
我必须首先强调一点
there's one thing I must make absolutely clear.

493
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,268
这话一定不能传出去
This must not get out.

494
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,869
要是工会听闻了风声
If the unions were to get to hear of this

495
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,633
准要闹翻天了
all hell would be let loose.

496
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,040
好的
Oh, yes.

497
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:02,628
当然要进行裁员 不裁减...
Of course there'll be redundancies. You simply...

498
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:07,098
不裁减冗余的工作人员
You simply can't slim down a giant bureaucracy

499
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,900
如何精简庞大的官僚机构
like this without getting rid of people.

500
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,260
最终 会裁减大量人员
Ultimately, a lot of people.

501
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,336
您为何不首先与工会商量呢?
Won't you be holding discussions with the Unions first?

502
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:16,762
我们会做做样子 进行磋商
We'll go through the charade of discussions,

503
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,740
但你也知道工会分子们都是些什么人
but you know what Trade Unionists are like;

504
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,753
就会胡搅蛮缠 个个愚蠢透顶
thick as two short planks and bloody minded.

505
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,257
个个如此?
All of them?

506
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,002
几乎都是 天哪 你该有体会
Pretty well. Good lord, you should know.

507
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,427
工会之间只热衷于互挖墙脚
They're interested in poaching each other's members

508
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:32,394
争上电视 还管不住自己的大嘴巴
and get themselves on the telly and they can't keep their big mouths shut.

509
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,668
司机和交通服务人员怎么办?
What about drivers and transport service staff?

510
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,468
当然是首当其冲
First to go. Good lord.

511
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:40,773
我们在轿车与司机上浪费了大量财力
We waste a fortuna on cars and drivers.

512
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,736
-而他们个个好逸恶劳  -懂了
- And they're all on the fiddle. - Oh, I see.

513
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,818
其实 我刚才正要解释
Because, as I was trying to explain that,

514
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:49,222
我不是Brough先生的代表
I'm not Mr. Brough's deputy.

515
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,353
我是行政部门交通工人
I'm the General Secretary of the Union of

516
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:56,249
以及政府辅助人员工会的总书记
Civil Service Transport and Associated Government Workers.

517
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,339
我
Ah. I...

518
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,866
我来此是为了核实
I came here to check there was no truth in

519
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,851
裁减我成员的谣传是否属实
the rumours of redundancies for my members.

520
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,815
好吧 我...
Well... I... I...

521
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,213
我刚才的意思是...
All I meant was...

522
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:10,337
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

523
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,950
(行政交通部门罢工)


524
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,437
他逐字引用我的话
He quotes me, word for word:

525
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:32,605
“当然要进行裁员 大量人员”
"Of course there will be redundancies. Lots!"

526
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,709
万分抱歉 大臣
I'm most terribly sorry.

527
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,329
所有司机都罢工了?
Are all the drivers on strike?

528
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,802
全部响应
100% response.

529
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:39,918
Bernard 你怎么能眼看着它发生?
How could you allow this to happen?

530
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,630
C.B.E. 大臣阁下
C.B.E., Minister.

531
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:43,537
什么C.B.E.?
C.B.E.?

532
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,005
无法面面俱到
Can't be everywhere.

533
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:49,891
当然 在通常情况下...
Of course, in normal circumstances...

534
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,594
好了 好了 知道了 知道了
Yes. Yes. I know, I know.

535
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:54,875
恕我提醒 您和您夫人8点要出席
Would you mind if I remind you. You and Mrs. Hacker are due

536
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,215
法国大使馆的招待会
at the French Embassy at 8 o'clock.

537
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,718
对 帮我备车好吗?
Oh, yes. Get me the car, will you?

538
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,331
最好先给我夫人打个电话
Oh... Better ring Mrs. Hacker,

539
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,122
让她开我们的车进城
ask her to bring our car into town.

540
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:08,199
恐怕无法如您所愿 大臣
Well I have to explore the possibility, minister.

541
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,397
您夫人说将它放在修车厂修理了
Mrs. Hacker said she had dropped it off at the garage.

542
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,322
她就不能明天再修吗
She'll have to do that tomorrow.

543
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:15,098
它可以把我们送至Kensington
It'll get us as far as Kensington anyway.

544
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,341
至少这不成问题
At least there are no problems about that.

545
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,690
Annie 不妙 我们必须步行
Annie, it's no good. We'll have to walk.

546
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,194
你带伞了吗?
Have you got the umbrella?

547
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,225
没 你呢?
No, haven't you?

548
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,753
这下好了
Terrific.

549
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,035
你走错方向了
You're going the wrong way.

550
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,571
没有 我是要回家
I'm not, I'm going home.

551
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,642
Annie 我知道这是什么问题了
Annie! I think I've found what's wrong.

552
00:23:52,642 --> 00:23:54,017
我早就知道了
I know I have!

553
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,017
(法国大使馆)


554
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,542
先生 有何贵干?
Oui, Monsieur?

555
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:15,291
女皇任命的行政大臣
Her Majesty's Minister for Administrative Affairs.

556
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,624
我的车坏了
My car broke down.

557
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,267
Hacker先生 看来您需要喝点香槟
Mr. Hacker, you look as if you need some champagne.

558
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,291
是的 大量
I do. Lots!

559
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:34,230
Hacker先生?
Mr. Hacker?

560
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,121
谢了 老兄
Thanks, mate.

561
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,419
黄色小报
Gutter press!

562
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:52,863
好吧 上面写了什么?
All right, what do they say?

563
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,737
“节约大师香槟酒会后醉卧排水沟”
Mr. Economy falls down in gutter after champagne party".

564
00:25:57,737 --> 00:25:59,955
-老天  -这个好点
- Oh, my God! - This one is better.

565
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:02,881
“哈克在大使招待会后疲惫不堪 情绪失控”
"Hacker tired and emotional after Embassy reception".

566
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,270
-这叫好点?  -至少有些不同
- Is that better? - It's different.

567
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,435
有没有谁说过任何
Do any of them say anything

568
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,306
“疲惫不堪 情绪失控”之外的话?
other than "tired and emotional"?

569
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:12,730
William·Hickey说您过度兴奋 大臣阁下
William Hickey said you were overwrought, Minister.

570
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,021
只是“过度兴奋”?
Just "overwrought"?

571
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,243
没有提到醉酒?
Nothing about being drunk?

572
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:16,391
只有“过度兴奋”
Just "overwrought".

573
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,978
原话其实是“过度兴奋如同笨蛋”
"Overwrought as a newt", actually.

574
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,816
还能有比这更糟吗 还有吗?
It couldn't really be any worse. Could they?

575
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:25,101
我不想打击您 大臣
I don't want to depress you, minister...

576
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,811
但“泰晤士报”上有个头版报道
but there is just this lead story in The Times.

577
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:29,989
的确更糟!
It is worse!

578
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,982
“哈克征募了400名新公务员
"Hacker recruit 400 new Civil Servants in,

579
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,680
在其‘节约运动’期间”
quote, 'economy drive'"!

580
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,457
-增加400名公务员?  -大臣 您吩咐用他们
- 400 more Civil Servants? - Minister, You asked for them.

581
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:40,632
您要求彻底的研究 收集事实和数据
You demanded a complete study and survey, facts and figures.

582
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,043
这些措施得有人手才行
These measures cannot be taken with none people.

583
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:46,197
你想出了额外的工作 就必须雇佣更多的人手
You create more jobs. More people have to be employed to do it.

584
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:47,630
这是常识而已
It's common sense.

585
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,897
如果您还坚持落实政府部门监察办公室
If you persist with the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office,

586
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:54,139
那就至少还要再添400个新职位
there'll be another 400 new jobs there as well.

587
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,278
-我们该如何是好?  -大臣阁下
- What are we going to do? - Well, Minister...

588
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:02,669
如果我们停止节约运动
If we were to end the economy drive

589
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:05,280
关闭政府部门监察办公室
and close the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office,

590
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,571
我们可以立即发布新闻通告
we could issue an immediate press announcement

591
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,035
说您砍掉了800个职位
that you'd axed 800 jobs.

592
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:12,914
现在您只需瞟一眼这份草拟的提案
Now, if you'd care to glance at this draft proposal...

593
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,784
但没人担任过这些职位啊 还没任命过谁呢
But nobody's doing those jobs. Nobody has been recruited yet.

594
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,102
这样节约就更为可观
And even greater economy,

595
