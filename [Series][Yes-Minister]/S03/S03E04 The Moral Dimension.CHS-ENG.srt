00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:42,173
操守问题

5
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:50,261
我们真的不会被指控浪费公款吧?
We can't be accused of wasting money?

6
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:54,181
当然不会 大臣      代表团已经缩到最小了?
Absolutely. We are taking the smallest delegation?

7
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:57,464
当然了 简直削皮见骨     那些人是谁?
Absolutely. Pared to the bone. Who are all those people?

8
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:04,983
我们的小代表团      你说削皮见骨的
Our delegation. You said it抎 been pared to the bone.

9
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,456
是的     那他们?
So it has. Who are they?

10
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:11,939
首先是外交部的小代表团
A small delegation from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

11
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:16,100
可这是行政部的任务     是啊 可确实要出国
But this is a DAA mission. Yes, well, we are gong abroad.

12
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,258
外交问题 事关重大
Foreign policy is at stake.

13
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:20,258
我们将要签署有史以来
We're gong to ratify a contract

14
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:23,419
英国与波斯湾最大的出口协议
for one of the biggest export orders Britain抯 ever obtained.

15
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:27,182
但这是英国电子设备公司谈成的
That was negotiated by British Electronic Systems.

16
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:29,861
那些公务员来干什么?
Who are all these civil servants?

17
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:34,020
外贸部有个代表团 工业部也有
There's a delegation from Trade and one from industry.

18
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,816
能源部有个小组 毕竟我们要去石油国家
There's a group from Energy. We are gong to an oil sheikdom.

常务副长带领的内阁办公室的团
There's a Deputy Secretary leading a team from the Cabinet Office.

20
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:44,187
还有情报部的团
There's a group from the Central Office of Information,

21
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,815
还有我们行政部的团
and there's our DAA team.

22
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:50,696
新闻秘书 私人秘书 联络秘书

23
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:54,860
法律部 草拟合同的 监督合同的
The legal department who did the contract supervised it.

24
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,097
削皮见骨?     削皮见骨
Pared to the bone? To the bone.

25
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:01,260
可我们在米德郡见面的时候 只带了7个人
If we'd met in Middlesbrough, we'd have only taken seven people.

26
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:06,455
没错 可米德郡的外交意义恐怕不如库朗
Teesside is not quite so diplomatically significant as kumran.

27
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:11,064
米德郡有4位议员      库朗控制壳牌和英国石油
Teesside returns four MPs. Kumran controls Shell and BP.

28
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:17,580
你来干什么?     完全出于"免税"考虑
What are you doling here? Purely my sense of duty-free.

29
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,146
免税?
Duty-free?

30
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:23,664
免除私人考虑 纯为纳税人着想
Er... duty, free from any personal consideration.

31
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,387
请您先看看这个     是什么?
Look through this. What is it?

32
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,981
是最终公报     最终公报?
it抯 the final communiqu? The final?

33
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,536
怎能在会前就写公报?
You can't write it before the meeting!

34
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:35,495
正相反 大臣 不能留到会后写公报
On the contrary, you can't write it after the meeting.

35
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,340
我们得跟诸多部门达成共识
We had to get agreement from other departments,

36
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,340
欧共体 华盛顿 库朗大使馆
the EEC, Washington, the kumrani Embassy.

37
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:43,702
在一片沙漠里根本忙不过来
You can't do that in the desert.

38
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,017
这跟我们要讲的完全没关系
It may bear no relation to what we say.

39
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:49,543
公报跟我们要讲的一向没关系
No communiqu?ever bears any relation to what you say.

40
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:53,700
那为什么要写?     好让媒体有东西报道
Then why have one? It gets you past the press corps.

41
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:58,258
记者需要解释他们采访这件无用功的昂贵账单
journalists justly their expenses for a futile non-event.

42
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:02,261
无用功?     哦 您会功勋显赫的 大臣
Non-event? A brilliant triumph for you, Minister.

43
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:05,703
所以对媒体来说就是无用功了
Which is why it抯 a futile non-event for the press.

44
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:09,143
他们巴不得我在招待会上撒酒疯
They'd like me to get drunk at the reception.

45
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:12,777
是啊 但这次没指望了 库朗很枯燥
Yes. Not much hope of that. Kumran is dry.

46
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:16,735
对 那当然 沙漠中央嘛
Yeah. Well, of course, It is in the middle of the desert.

47
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,777
你是说 伊斯兰教法?     唉 是的
You mean... Islamic law Alas, yes.

48
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,176
英国大使馆有酒的吧     是的
We can get a drink at the British Embassy?

49
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:31,306
使馆有 可招待会和晚宴在皇宫举行
Yes. But the reception and the dinner are at the palace.

50
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,298
五小时的橘子汁
Five hours of orange juice.

51
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,026
五个小时 滴酒不沾?
Five hours? Without a single drinky

52
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,981
你怎能让我出这种差 汉弗莱?
Why did you let me come on this trip?

53
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,536
怎么办 裤兜里藏酒壶?
What are we gong to do? Hip flasks?

54
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:47,143
不行 太冒险了 只好咬牙强忍
No, much too risky. We have to grin and bear it.

55
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:51,139
能不能设一个秘密通讯室?
Why don抰 we set up a security communications room

56
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:52,979
就在宴会厅隔壁?
next door to the reception?

57
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:56,935
紧急电话 直通唐宁街的电报线之类
You know, emergency telephones, telex lines to Downing Street.

58
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:01,100
把使馆带去的酒藏在里面
Then we could fill it with booze brought in from the Embassy.

59
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,701
大臣     给橘汁加点料
Minister! Liven up the orange juice!

60
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,545
这简直是...天才的主意
That is a... stroke of genius!

61
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:13,577
能做到吗?     重大危机才需要秘密通讯室
Could it be done? Such a room would need a major crisis.

62
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:16,341
五小时橘汁就是重大危机
Five hours on orange juice Is a major crisis.

63
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,305
英镑走势确实不好      能安排吗?
The pound is under pressure. Could you arrange it?

64
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:24,302
大臣 您的指示 我保证强力支持
your instructions I can guarantee my support.

65
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:45,344

17世纪伊斯兰艺术的典型代表

00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,620
原本是做什么用的?     玫瑰香水罐
What was it originally? A rosewater jar.

71
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:06,815
明白了 是...放玫瑰香水的?     正是
I see. For rosewater, presumably? Quite so.

72
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,981
打扰了 大臣 通讯室有紧急电话 是海格先生
Mr Haig call you in communications room

73
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:18,339
海格将军吗?

不 海格先生 有"酒窝"那位(海格添宝威士忌)

75
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,577
好好 失礼了 这很重要
Yes, yes. Do excuse me. Most important.

I believe there's a message from Mr Haig. Yes, Minister.

我是这唯一的女人     是的 这是特许
I'm the only woman here. Special dispensation.

78
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:54,064
今晚他们把您奉为男人
They've made you an honorary man for the evening.

79

放我家门厅一定很漂亮     哈克夫人 我不确定

82
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,176
不 恐怕您不能留着它     为什么?
I don't think you'll be allowed to keep it. Why ever not?

83
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:11,545
如果它很值钱 会对某些大臣有影响
if it were valuable, It could influence some ministers.

84
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:13,726
不是您的大臣 是我的大臣

就是这样 我是说...有些大臣...

00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:27,940
你是说把它还回去?     不 那会被当作侮辱
Are you saying we have to give it back? No, that'd be an insult.

89
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:32,180
不能留 不能还 那怎么办?      会变成政府财产
We can't give it back. It becomes government property.

通过估价     你能找人估价吗
You get a valuation. Could you get a valuation?

93

Perhaps I can help. That would be...

137
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:31,025
您知道值多少钱吗?     当然
Do you have any idea how much? Of course.

138
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:34,736
真的17世纪的玫瑰香水罐很昂贵的
An original 17th-century rosewater jar Is very valuable.

139
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,660
哦 天哪     您不高兴吗?
Oh, dear. You are not pleased?

140
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,184
是也不是 如果很值钱 大臣就不能留下了
Yes and no. If it抯 valuable, the minister won't be allowed to keep it.

141
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,941
我希望它不那么值钱
I was rather hoping it wasn抰.

142
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:46,981
我刚说
As I was saying,

143
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:50,537
17世纪的玫瑰香水罐 真品很昂贵
an original 17th-century rosewater jar is very valuable,

144
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:54,905
但这件仿制品 尽管逼真 却大不相同
but this copy, though excellently done, Is not of the same order.

145
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,218
太好了 大概多少钱?
Oh, good. About how much?

146
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,021
我想让你来猜猜看
I would be interested to hear your guess.

147
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,543
差不多...低于50镑?
Er... well, a little under... 50?

148
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,256
太厉害了 您真是位内行
Brilliant! Quite a connoisseur!

149
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,338
您能签估价证明吗?
And you would sign a valuation certificate?

150
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:13,735
当然了
But of course.

151
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:18,776
你们英国人真奇怪     怎么?
Your English customs are very strange. Oh, why?

152
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:21,256
你们对一件小礼物如此严苛
You are so strict about a gift,

153
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:25,420
可你们电子公司又给我们金融部长几百万美元
your company pays our finance minister a million dollars

154
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:27,578
保证合同的签署
to secure this contract.

155
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,738
这不奇怪吗?
Is this not strange?

156
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,496
你 你难道是说      当然
You... You don't mean... Of course.

157
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,739
我就是为金融部长工作的 我也有份
I work for the minister. I got my share.

158
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:41,536
用来干什么?     遮口费啊
What for? For keeping my mouth shut.

159
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,945
我明白了 抱歉我先走了
II see. Would you excuse me For a moment?

160
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:51,019
大臣 我能跟汉弗莱爵士私下说句话吗?
Minister, can I have a private word with Sir Humphrey?

161
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,781
你尽管说吧小伯纳
You may speak freely, Bernie.

162
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:57,735
好的...哦 通讯室有您的电话
There was a message for you in the room.

163
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,660
提税的 来提您的69号     什么?
The VAT man, your 69 returns. What?

164
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,299

165
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,464
好好 谢谢你
Yes... thanks.

166
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,575
我突然发现 伯纳
I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion

167
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,544
大臣接的紧急电话
that the minister has had

168
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,699
已经到达极限了
almost as many urgent messages as he can take.

169
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,462
我发现了更可怕的事     天哪
I've found out the most terrible thing. Dear me.

170
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:24,936
那份合同是贿赂来的
This contract was obtained by bribery.

171
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,825
当然
Of course.

172
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,142
库朗每份合同都是贿赂来的
All contracts in kumran are obtained by bribery.

173
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,581
人人都知道
Everybody knows that.

174
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:34,420
没关系 只要没人知道就行
It's all right, as long as nobody knows.

175
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,462
不该告诉大臣吗?     当然不该
Shouldn抰 we tell the minister? Certainly not.

176
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:41,017
但人人都知道     除了大臣
But if everybody knows. Everybody else.

177
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:44,543
不能让大臣知道人人都知道的事
We do not let a minister know what everybody else knows.

178
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:47,301
殿下 幸会幸会
Highness, how very nice to see you.

179
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:51,255
阿拉伯的劳伦斯 通讯室找你呢
you're wanted in the communications room.

180
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,418
好的 是谁?
Oh, good. Er, who is it?

181
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,384
拿破仑(白兰地)
Napoleon!

182
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:07,577
"世界报声称 英国最近与库朗的合同"
"Le Monde says the British contract with kumran

183
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,738
"是贿赂来的"
was won by bribery."

184
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:13,220
你听见了吗 汉弗莱?     是的 大臣
Do you hear this, Humphrey? Yes, indeed.

185
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:16,060
"这张骇人听闻的腐败之网"
"It's part of a hideous web of corruption

186
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,183
"由西方工业国家与第三世界"
woven by Western Industrial countries

187
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:19,905
"合织而成"
and Third World governments

188
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,786
"是我们现代文明的一个污点"
that forms a blot of our modern civilisation."

189
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:25,666
网不会变成污点 大臣      什么?
Webs don't form blots, Minister. What?

190
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,545
蜘蛛没有墨水 您看
Well, spiders don't have any ink, you see.

191
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:32,584
只有墨鱼才有
Only cuttlefish.

192
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:36,296
蜘蛛没有…你在说什么?     我知道
What are you talking about? I know...

193
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:40,665
谢谢 伯纳     太可怕了吧 空穴来风
Thank you, Bernard. Isn't this terrible? Baseless accusations!

194
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,022
是是 真可怕
Oh, yes, yes, terrible.

195
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:46,338
好处费 回扣 天啊 我们可是英国人
Backsheesh, palm-greasing! Good God, we're British!

196
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:49,101
毋庸置疑 大臣
Absolutely, Minister!

197
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,778
金融时报不太可能空穴来风
It's not like the FT to print a story like this

198
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,744
除非幕后另有文章
unless there's something behind it.

199
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,705
幕后有文章吗 汉弗莱?
Is there something behind it, Humphrey?

200
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,256
我想后面是体育新闻
I think the sports news Is behind it.

201
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:06,340
我想知道真相 汉弗莱     您不想 大臣
I want to know the truth, Humphrey. I don't think you do.

202
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:11,305
你能直接回答吗?     我强烈建议您不要直接问
Will you answer a direct question?

203
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,901
为什么?     因为我可能直接回答
Why? It might provoke a direct answer.

204
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,140
你从没直接过
It never has yet.

205
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,424
伯纳 你知道怎么回事吗? 老实告诉我
What do you know about this? Tell me!

206
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:26,183
那个 我...是这样的 有人
Oh, well, I... Er, that is... there was. Someone did.

207
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,339
传言而已 大臣 传闻 道听途说
A lot of gossip, that's all. Rumour, hearsay.

208
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,496
伯纳?
Bernard?

209
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:35,065
有个库朗人说他收到了...     道听途说 大臣
One kumrani did tell me he'd received... Hearsay, Minister.

210
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,866
道听途说?     伯纳半道听到了他说
Hearsay? Yes, Bernard heard him say it.

211
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,182
汉弗莱 你是说合同确实是贿赂来的?
Are you telling me that the contract was won by bribery

212
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,419
大臣 请您别用贿赂这个词
I do wish you wouldn't use words like bribery.

213
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:50,819
那要用什么词? 脏钱 甜头 红包?
What would you like me to say? Slush funds, brown envelopes?

214
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:54,582
大臣 这词太残酷无理了
These are extremely crude and unworthy expressions

215
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:57,545
不能形容这种创意谈判
for what is no more than creative negotiation.

216
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,425
这是潜规则罢了
It is general practice.

217
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:04,786
你知道你在说什么吗? 我签合同是出于良心
You do realise what you're saying?

218
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,211
是 大臣      公报里我说
In that press communiqu?

219
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:10,307
英国是通过公平竞争赢的
I announced a British success won in a fair fight!

220
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,105
是的 这部分我也好奇来着
Yes, I did wonder about that bit.

221
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:16,464
现在你说 是贿赂来的     不 大臣
Now you're telling me It was got by bribery.

222
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:20,415
哦 不是贿赂来的      我没这么说
Oh, it was not got by bribery That is not what I said.

223
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:21,981
你怎么说?
What did you say?

224
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:25,105
我说我没告诉您那是贿赂来的
That I'm not telling you It was got by bribery.

225
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:28,505
你怎么形容合同的支付款项?
How would you describe these payments?

226
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,135
合同是怎么形容的?      对
How does the contract describe them?

227
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,945
哦 这就简单了
Oh, well, that's quite simple.

228
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,905
聘金 私人捐献 特别折扣
Retainers, personal donations, special discounts.

229
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,535
杂项开支 中介费
Miscellaneous outgoings, agents' fees,

230
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:41,699
政治献金 管理支出
political contributions, management expenses.

231
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:44,017
这些款项是怎么支付的?
How are these payments made?

232
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:47,179
各种渠道 从瑞士银行帐号
Anything from a numbered Swiss account

233
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:51,943
到洗手间门缝的小信封都有
to a fistful of used oncers slipped under the door of the gents'.

234
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:57,101
你知道这有多可怕吗?      地域偏见罢了
Do you realise how shocking this is? That is a narrow view.

235
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:00,225
世上另一些地区 人们持有不同的意见
In other parts of the world, they see things differently.

236
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:03,379
罪恶不分地域 汉弗莱     但确实有关
Sin is not a branch of geography. But it is.

237
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:08,143
在发展中国家 合同外支付金的数额
In developing countries, the size of the extra contractual payment

238
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,582
代表我们的诚意
shows how serious you are.

239
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:13,307
就像出版社提前的支付作家版税
It's like a publisher抯 advance to an author.

240
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:17,824
谁出的高 代表谁的预期销售额高
Whoever pays the biggest advance expects the biggest sales.

241
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,420
我简直不敢相信
I don't believe it!

242
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,782
难道腐败也是政府的政策?
Is corruption government policy?

243
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:25,781
不 大臣 腐败从来就不是政策
No, no, Minister! It could never be government policy!

244
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:29,576
简直不可思议 它只是政府惯例
That is unthinkable! Only government practice.

245
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:32,065
新闻办打来的 大臣
That was the press office.

246
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:35,219
报纸希望您对贿赂事件发表声明
The papers want a statement about the bribery allegation.

247
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:37,184
声明 我能说什么呢?
What am I gong to say?

248
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:40,862
新闻办总有一套有说服力的空话
The press office can devise something convincing

249
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,824
这是他们的工作
That's what they're paid for.

250
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:46,425
你是个愤世者 汉弗莱     愤世者
You're a cynic, Humphrey. Cynic.

251
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:50,023
愤世者是理想主义者对现实主义者的称呼
A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist.

252
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:54,224
我必须说出事实 我毕竟对此一无所知
I'll tell the truth. After all, I knew nothing of this.

253
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,942
不是我安排的 凭什么要我负责?
Why should I back something I never approved?

254
00:15:57,107 --> 00:16:00,304
可这合同里有几千份英国工人的工作
But this contract means thousands of British jobs,

255
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,298
上百万出口额
millions of export dollars!

256
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:06,585
您不会为一点操作不规范就抛弃它们吧?
you won't throw that away because technical irregularly?

257
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,978
这不是"操作不规范" 这是腐败
It's not a technical irregularly, It is corruption!

258
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:14,060
不 大臣 只是合同外的预付金
No. Merely a few subcontracted pre-payments.

259
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,979
汉弗莱 我不指望你理解
I don't expect you to understand,

260
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:19,776
但政府执政不光是手腕和心眼
but government is not just a question of fixing and manipulating.

261
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:24,737
还有操守问题      可不是 操守问题
There is a moral dimension. of course, the moral dimension.

262
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,501
我从没忘记过这个问题
It is never out of my thoughts.

263
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:32,138
如果媒体问我 我将宣布展开调查
So if questions are asked in the press, I shall announce an inquiry.

264
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,105
好主意 大臣 我很乐意主持
Splendid idea. I shall be happy to conduct it.

265
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,656
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:41,661
不是内部调查 是真的调查
No, not an internal inquiry, a real inquiry.

267
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:44,022
大臣 您开玩笑吧     一场真的调查
You can't be serious! A real inquiry.

268
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:47,702
大臣 求您了     汉弗莱 操守问题
I beg you... Humphrey... the moral dimension.

269
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,266
晚上好 哈克夫人     伯纳 请进
Good evening, Mrs Hacker. Bernard, come in.

270
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:58,224
谢谢     是你吗 伯纳?
Thank you. Is that you, Bernard?

271
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,378
是我 大臣     我马上来
Yes, Minister. Shan't be a moment.

272
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,424
是库朗的香水罐
There's that jar from kumran.

273
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,943
是啊 我有个朋友非常感兴趣
A friend of mine was frightfully interested in it.

274
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,416
是吗?     珍妮古德温 卫报的
Really? Jenny Goodwin from The Guardian.

275
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,384
卫报?     她问哪来的
The Guardian? She asked where it came from.

276
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:17,142
她是个记者?     是啊 虽然是卫报
A journalist? Yes. Well, The Guardian, anyway.

277
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:23,540
她问值多少钱 我说50镑      你说50镑
She asked what it was worth. I said 50. You said 50.

278
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,505
对 奇怪的是 她认为这是真品
Funnlly enough, she thought it was genulne.

279
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,464
她认为这是真品
She thought It was genulne?

280
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,619
对 伯纳 你听起来像部电话答录机
Bernard, you sound like an answerlng machlne.

281
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:32,902
噢 抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

282
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,662
她要打电话问库朗大使馆 它到底值多少

问它到底值多少

284
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,976
您怎么说?     我说 随便你
So what did you say? I said, by all means.

285
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,217
这确实是仿的 不是吗?
It is only a copy, isn抰 it?

286
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,895
那个...据我所知...
Well... so far as I'm...

287
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:54,063
我也...天哪 几点了?
so I'm lead to... Good gracious, is that the time?

288
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:00,260
伯纳     抱歉 大臣要晚几分钟到
Sorry, the minister will be a few minutes late.

289
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,986
我过会儿再来
I'll come back.

290
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:08,583
其实 汉弗莱爵士 我想跟您说句话
Actually, I wonder if I could have a word.

291
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:09,862
好
Yes.

292
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,585
我说好     是 我知道
I said yes. Yes, I know.

293
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,338
您瞧
You see...

294
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,782
出岔子了 伯纳?
Something the matter, Bernard?

295
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:24,345
开口吧 说出来
Come on, out with it.

296
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,459
你送大臣去错了晚宴?
Did you send the minister to the wrong dinner?

297
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,864
拿错了他的演讲稿?
Give him the wrong speech?

298
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:35,499
给他看了我们不想让他看的文件?
Show him some papers we didn抰 mean him to see?

299
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,065
更糟?
Worse?

300
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,345
还要更糟?
Much worse?

301
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,339
坐下
Sit down.

302
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:53,425
好吧 全告诉我
Well... tell me about it.

303
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:57,057
您知道大臣在库朗收的香水罐吧
You know that jar the minister was given in kumran?

304
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,946
大臣夫人...非常中意
Well, the minister's wife... liked it.

305
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,460
我想也是
I expect she did.

306
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:05,461
我跟她解释了规定 她好像...很伤心
Then, when I explained the rules to her, she looked... terribly sad.

307
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,463
他们都这样
They always do.

308
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:13,260
她说要是不值50英镑该有多好
She said wouldn't it be marvellous if it wasn't worth more than 50

309
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,861
她还...瞅着我
and she sort of... looked at me.

310
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,785
可我的好伯纳 一个17世纪的水罐
But, my dear Bernard, a 17th-century vase!

311
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:24,577
我知道 但正好有个非常和善的库朗商人
Yes, I know, but there was this terribly nice kumrani businessman

312
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:29,901
我们就...谈了一会儿
and we had a... a... a... conversation

313
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:34,458
他鉴定那罐子是仿制品 49.95镑
and he valued it as a copy, not as an original -49.95p.

314
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:41,979
你就信了     他说他是专家
You believed him. He said he was an expert.

315
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,263
他阿拉伯语说得非常棒
He spoke Arabic awfully well...

316
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:47,146
所以我就相信他的诚实了
and so I accepted his valuation in good faith.

317
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,867
毕竟 伊斯兰教很诚实的
After all, Islam is a jolly good faith.

318
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,696
伯纳 你太冒险了
You took a grave personal risk.

319
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,858
算你走运 还没人问
You're lucky nobody's asked questions.

320
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,587
对 可是卫报有个记者在大臣家看见了
A journalist saw it in the minister's house

321
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,499
提了很多疑问
and asked a lot of questions.

322
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,376
哈克夫人说那是仿的 可媒体...
Mrs Hacker said it was a copy, but the press are so...

323
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,378
他们都非常多疑
horribly suspicious about things.

324
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,825
真卑鄙     那我该怎么办呢
Despicable! So... what shall I do?

325
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,978
必须告诉大臣
The minister must be told.

326
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,856
抱歉让你久等了
Sorry to keep you.

327
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,746
没关系 您读了我的建议吗 大臣?
That's all right. Have you read my submission?

328
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,226
是的 但那不可行
I did, and it won抰 do.

329
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,424
我不会让人指控我包庇贿赂
I won't be accused of sweeping bribery under the carpet.

330
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:30,263
媒体问起 我会宣布由皇室律师主持调查
I will announce an inquiry chaired by a QC.

331
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:34,102
大臣 您不能 那合同值34000万
You can't! That contract is worth 340 million!

332
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,862
我不在乎 汉弗莱 操守问题
Get thee behind me, Humphrey! The moral dimension.

333
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:43,055
大臣 真要展开调查 其他事也会泄露
Minister, if there is an inquiry, other things may come out, too.

334
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,819
什么事?
Such as?

335
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:48,775
恐怕伯纳有话想说
I'm afraid Bernard... has something to tell you.

336
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,466
嗯?
Well?

337
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:56,782
嗯?
Well?

338
00:20:56,947 --> 00:21:00,064
您记得库朗送您那个水罐吧
You know that jar the kumranis gave you?

339
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:02,695
对 在我家摆着 非常漂亮
Yes, it抯 at the flat now. Most attractive.

340
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:06,860
我告诉哈克夫人 价值低于50镑才能留着
I told Mrs Hacker she could keep it if its less than 50.

341
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:11,498
估价人非常和蔼 我告诉他哈克太太很喜欢
The value was awfully nice and I told him Mrs Hacker liked it a lot,

342
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,023
于是他就...帮了点忙
but he may have been just, well, being helpful.

343
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:17,545
没关系 伯纳
It's all right, Bernard.

344
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,460
没人会知道的 你真会打算盘
No one will ever know. Jolly enterprising of you.

345
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:23,505
哈克夫人说有个记者问过她
Mrs Hacker told me a journalist was asking questions.

346
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:28,097
记者?     我能看看估价报告吗?
Journalist? Can I just see that valuation?

347
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:33,257
嗯 财政部不会喜欢
The Treasury isn抰 too happy

348
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:36,976
写在菜单背面的估价报告的
about valuations written on the backs of menus.

349
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,947
这份菜单很不错的
It is a very good menu.

350
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,779
到底值多少?
What is it worth?

351
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:45,620
如果是仿的 就值估的价钱
If it抯 a copy, what the valuation says.

352
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,584
如果是...原件呢?
And if it抯... genulne?

353
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,180
差不多5000镑
About 5,000.

354
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:52,020
天啊 我居然就拿了
Oh, my God, I kept it!

355
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,497
大臣 新闻办的比尔找您
Bill from the press office wants to talk to you.

356
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:59,262
不 伯纳 我正忙着你这码事呢
I'm trying to deal with this problem you've landed me with!

357
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,577
他就是说这个
That's what he wants to talk to you about.

358
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:02,736
什么?
Well?

359
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:06,104
大臣 外交部全乱套了
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in a frightful state.

360
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:10,738
哈克夫人告诉卫报说 库朗赠送的极度珍贵的
Mrs Hacker has told The Guardian that valuable 17th-century thing

361
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:13,580
17世纪艺术品是复制品
presented to you by kumran was a copy.

362
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:17,103
卫报打电话给库朗大使馆求证
The Guardian phoned the kumrani Embassy for their comments.

363
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:21,180
库朗非常愤怒 这暗示他们送给您假货
The kumran angry at the suggestion they insulted Britain

364
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,622
借以侮辱英国
by giving you a worthless gift.

365
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:28,019
这已成了"公主之死"以来最大的外交危机
It's the biggest diplomatic incident since "Death of a Princess".

366
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,937
有位卫报记者在外面等着见您
There's a reporter demanding to see you right away.

367
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:41,145
什么 伯纳?
Yes, Bernard?

368
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:47,146
大臣 您打算...     伯纳 我清楚我的责任
Minister... what are you... Bernard, my duty is clear.

369
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:50,299
我别无选择     别无选择?
I have no choice. No choice?

370
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,504
别无选择 伯纳 不是我让你骗我太太
No choice. I didn抰 ask you to lie to my wife

371
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,623
捏造礼物价格的
about the value of that gift.

372
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:56,776
不 但是...
No, but...

373
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:59,984
伯纳 我知道你是出于好意
I realise you acted from the purest motives.

374
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:03,537
但是抱歉 伪造文件的罪名无法推卸
But there can be no excuse for falsifying a document.

375
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:05,538
但我...     听我说完
But I... Let me continue.

376
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:08,301
我不能让人说 是我指使的你
I cannot have it said that I asked you to do this.

377
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:13,382
也不能被指责纵容腐败与贿赂
that I connived at bribery and corruption.

378
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:15,139
该适可而止了
Enough is enough.

379
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,099
如果记者直接提问
If this journalist asks me straight questions

380
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,859
关于这两件事
on either of these subjects...

381
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:24,181
我都会给她明确答复
I shall have to give her straight answers.

382
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,823
操守问题
The moral dimension.

383
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:30,099
大臣 我非常同意
Minister, I agree with you.

384
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:34,021
现在我明白了 什么事都要讲操守
I see now that there is a moral dimension to everything.

385
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:41,659
是您去告诉媒体那间紧急通讯室 还是我去?
Will you tell the press about the communications room or shall I?

386
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:45,466
什么?
What?

387
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:51,943
您知道的 在库朗喝的威士忌
You know, all the Scotch in kumran.

388
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,859
你是说 如果我说了...你就...
You mean to tell me that... If I say...

389
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:01,016
你就说...
then you will... tell...

390
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,298
陷我于...
and drop me in the...

391
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:08,820
陷您于操守问题
in the moral dimension.

392
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:11,696
这完全不一样
This is different!

393
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,744
根本就是两码事      怎么?
it抯 not the same thing! Why?

394
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:17,377
饮酒不是腐败     对 只是欺骗而已
Drinking, it抯 not corruption. No, it抯 just deceit.

395
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:20,141
欺骗?     我们欺骗了库朗人
Deceit? We have deceived the kumranis.

396
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:22,298
我良心极度不安
I'm racked with guilt.

397
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,618
饱受折磨 因为我们
Tormented by the knowledge

398
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:29,939
侵犯了神圣的伊斯兰教法 就在他们国土上
that we violated their sacred Islamic law in their own country.

399
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:36,102
迟早得站出来承认 那是您的主意
we'll have to own up and admit that it was your idea.

400
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,827
不是我     就是你
It wasn抰! It was!

401
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,262
不是我...是我吗?
It wasn抰... was it?

402
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:45,541
处50下鞭刑还是100下?
Is it 50 lashes or 100?

403
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:50,860
大臣 您必须见这个记者 不然她肯定胡编
I must ask you to meet this journalist.

404
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:54,463
是 好吧 可我能说什么呢?
Oh, yes, all right. What am I gong to say?

405
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:58,222
我建议 进攻是最好的防御
I suggest attack Is the best form of defence.

406
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:03,177
进攻 进攻 好主意 汉弗莱 明白了

00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,979
请进 请坐 珍妮 可以叫你珍妮吗?
Do come in. Sit down, Jenny. I may call you Jenny, may I not?

409
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:14,537
随您便     好 有什么问题?
If you like. Now, what seems to be the trouble?

410

有两件事 大臣 公众都非常忧心
Two things. Both of them Rather worrying to the public.

411
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:22,377
第一件 您可能已经在法国"世界报"读到了

412
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:27,143
电子公司靠贿赂与库朗签合同的事
It's about corruption in BES, getting the kumrani contract.

413
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:28,422
纯粹胡说八道
Complete nonsense!

414
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:31,659
可他们有官方付款报告
They quoted reports of payments to officials.

415
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,818
这简直太典型了
Really, this is absolutely typical.

416
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:37,900
一家英国公司呕心沥血争取订单 创造岗位
A British company slogs its guts out to win orders, create jobs!

417
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:41,059
