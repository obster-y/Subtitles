00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:42,040
迎难而上

5
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:46,962
本周四下午的重要新闻是政府改组问题
The main news this Thursday pm Is the big government re-shuffle.

6
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,159
来到我们演播室 探讨他的新帝国的是
I have with me, to discuss his new empire,

7
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,718
行政事务部大臣 詹姆斯哈克阁下
the Minister for Administrative Affairs, James Hacker.

8
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:59,802
据说您如今是市政厅 也是白厅的红人
It's been said that you are now Mr Town Hall as well as Mr Whitehall.

9
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,317
你太过奖了 阿路
Well, it’s very flattering of you to put it that way.

10
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:07,480
不是我说的 哈克先生 是每日镜报说的
It wasn’t me who put it that way, It was the Dally Mirror.

11
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:12,799
我只想确认下 您现在是我国最大的官僚
I just confirm that you are chief bureaucrat.

12
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:17,119
无稽之谈 本届政府以缩减官僚机构为己任
That's nonsense. This government believes in reducing bureaucracy.

13
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,845
我手头的数据
Figures I have here say

14
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,283
说您的部门员工上涨了10%
that your department’s staff has risen by 10%.

15
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,677
没那事      您的数据呢?
Certainly not. What figure do you have?

16
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:29,125
我相信顶多是9.97%
I believe the figure Is much more like 9.97.

17
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,005
有一种说法 哈克先生
Well, it has been suggested

18
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,761
说您的部门更乐于
that your department Is less interested

19
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,600
增加而不是减少官僚
in reducing bureaucracy than in increasing it.

20
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:41,283
是 不过这是由于我们得增加人手
Well, yes, but that's because we've had to take on more staff

21
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,358
才能最终裁员
in order to reduce staff.

22
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,442
此话怎讲?      道理很简单
I beg your pardon? it’s common sense.

23
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:49,207
要多治病人就要多请医生
We need more doctors to cure more patents,

24
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,642
要多灭火就要多请消防员
more firemen to extinguish more fires.

25
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,765
那您要如何消灭地方官僚主义?
How will you extinguish local government bureaucracy?

26
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,157
是很困难 所以要迎难而上
It's a challenge I'm looking forward to.

27
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,160
您同不同意 那里的官僚主义
Would you agree there's even more bureaucratic waste

28
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,726
比白厅还严重?
there than in Whitehall?

29
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,162
对 这正是难处之所在
Yes, that's what makes it a challenge.

30
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,283
那您要怎样迎难而上呢?
How will you meet the challenge?

31
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:09,007
眼下谈详细计划还为时过早
It's far too early to give detailed proposals.

32
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,556
我刚从唐宁街10号过来
I've just come here direct from Number 10.

33
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,719
莫不是9.97号?
From number9.97, perhaps!

34
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:19,724
大政方针是要大刀阔斧消减浪费
The broad strategy Is to cut ruthlessly at waste

35
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,401
又不影响核心职能
while leaving essential services intact.

36
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:26,082
您前任也是这么说的 您是说他失败了?
That's what your predecessor said. Did he fall?

37
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:29,438
请听我说完 因为这点必须表明
Let me finish. Because we must be absolutely clear

38
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,360
我也要跟你挑明了说
and I'm gong to be quite frank with you.

39
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:38,917
其实总而言之 我们的权利 我们的义务
The fact is that, at the end of the day, It is the right, the duty,

40
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,079
我们下院的民选政府
of the elected government in the House of Commons

41
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:46,240
就是要捍卫政府政策 政策选出了我们
to ensure government policy on which we were elected

42
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,363
政策委我们以重任
and for which we have a mandate,

43
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,995
也是政策 吸引人民投票
the policies for which the people voted,

44
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,397
政策同样 说到底
are the policies which, finally,

45
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,764
分割了国家这块蛋糕...
when the national cake has been divided up...

46
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:01,921
容我提醒你 我们国家可不是聚宝盆
we, as a nation, don't have unlimited wealth?

47
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,840
我们的薪水不能超过收入
We can't pay ourselves more than we earn.

48
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,202
而政策...
...are the policies...

49
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:14,037
不好意思 你再问一遍?
I'm sorry, what was the question again?

50
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:17,119
哈克先生 我问您是否同意
I was just asking you whether you would agree

51
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,517
您的前任失败了
that your predecessor had failed.

52
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,121
当然没有 恰恰相反
Certainly not. On the contrary.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,478
正因为这项工作要求大力...
It's just that this job Is an enormous...

54
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,158
迎难而上?      正是
Challenge? Exactly!

55
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:36,281
对了 昨天你那位上广播了 小汉
Incidentally, I heard your chap on the radio yesterday, Humpy.

56
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,716
说得好像要做点什么
He sounded as if he wanted to do things

57
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,242
用用你们新的地方政府管辖权
about your new local government remit.

58
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:46,881
他反复说要迎难而上
He kept calling it a challenge.

59
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,844
祝贺你 汉弗莱      多谢
Congratulations. Very kind.

60
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,919
你的分量就快超过阿诺德了
You may soon be even more important than Arnold!

61
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,999
对 我想...不不不
Yes, I expect... Er, no, no, no, no, no.

62
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,282
我话说在前头 汉弗莱
I do want to be quite clear about this.

63
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,483
要是我以为你会让哈克做任何事
I'd never have given you local government

64
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,956
当初我绝不会给你地方政府的
if I'd thought you'd let Hacker do anything.

65
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:07,678
他当然不会 没人做得到      这不是重点 小汉
He won't be able to. Nobody else has. That's not the point, Humpy.

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,238
经验表明 凡是地方政府改革 总反弹到我们头上
in the past all local government reforms rebound on us.

67
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,523
无论谁想出办法省钱
When anybody finds a way of saving money

68
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,678
或裁员 在地方政府有用
or cutting staff in local government,

69
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,963
在白厅也照样有用
It works for Whitehall just as well.

70
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,766
对 可地方政府机构臃肿
Yes, but local government Is extravagant,

71
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,441
尾大不掉 能力低下 而我们...
overstaffed, incompetent, whereas we...

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,362
正是      我清楚我的职责 阿诺德
Exactly so. I know my duty, Arnold.

73
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,807
如果他非得找点事做
If he needs something to keep him busy,

74
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,241
你知道怎么办吧?
you know what to do?

75
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,762
给他民防系统
Get him to look into civil defence.

76
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,886
民防? 你说核掩体?
Civil defence? You mean fallout shelters?

77
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:44,719
是啊 政府早就断定
Governments long ago decided

78
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,242
民防这事无足轻重
civil defence was not a serious issue.

79
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,204
十万火急而已
Merely a desperate one!

80
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,521
最好留给那些肯定办事不力的人
It's best left to those whose Incompetence can be relied upon.

81
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,678
地方政府
Local authorities!

82
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:02,121
但政府的最高职责莫过于保卫人民
But the highest duty of government Is to protect its citizens.

83
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:06,081
所以这事得交给市政委员会
Presumably that's why they leave it to the borough councils!

84
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:13,966
多谢 先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

85
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,280
大臣 打扰一下 我有个构想
Can I have a word about a proposal I worked out

86
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,245
我们并入行政部之前提出过
before we were transferred to this department?

87
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:24,763
你是?      我是...什么?
And you are? I am... what?

88
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:29,037
对啊 你是什么?      什么?
Yes, you are what? What?

89
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:34,043
什么?      我是卡赖特博士
What? I am Dr Cartwright.

90
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:37,438
我换个问法 大臣 你哪来的?
If I may put it another way, what are you?

91
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,918
我圣公会的
I'm C of E.

92
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:47,200
不 大臣是问 你在这个部门任什么职务?
what function do you perform in the department?

93
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:51,565
你不知道?      我知道 可大臣想知道
Don't you know Yes, but the Minister wants to know.

94
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,445
我是经济专家
I'm a professional economist.

95
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,326
地方行政统计主任
Director Local Administration Statistics.

96
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,684
我们接管前 地方行政统计部门就是你管啊
You ran the Local Authority Directorate before we took over.

97
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:03,044
当然不是 戈登爵士才是常任秘书
Dear me, no. Sir Gordon Reid was the Permanent Secretary.

98
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:07,405
我只是个副秘书 升职也没指望
I'm just Under-Secretary rank. I fear l shall rise no higher.

99
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,559
怎么?      唉 我是专家嘛
Why not? Alas, I'm an expert.

100
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:15,161
什么专家?      所有方面的专家
On what? On the whole thing.

101
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:18,364
都在这里      这是什么?
it’s all in here. What's this all about?

102
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,802
地方开支监控计划
Controlling council expenditure.

103
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:24,960
我提议凡地方政务委员会上马新项目
all council officials responsible for a new project

104
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:28,324
批准前先要制定衡量指标
List their criteria for failure before getting the go-ahead.

105
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:34,281
什么意思?      这是基本科学手段
What do you mean? it’s a basic scientific approach.

106
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,756
做实验必须先建立
You must establish a method of measuring

107
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,236
测量成败的标准
the success or failure of an experiment.

108
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:42,763
做完之后才知道是成是败
When it’s completed, you know if it’s succeeded or failed.

109
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:48,600
在计划书里表明 "该计划不应超过多长时间"
A propose states "This scheme would fall if it lasts longer than this

110
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:52,760
"花掉多少钱 或者动用多少人手"
or costs more than that, if it employs more staff than these

111
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,282
"或者达不到其他既定标准"
or falls to meet pre-set standards."

112
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,126
太棒了 可惜行不通
Fantastic! You could never make it work.

113
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,676
当然行的通 都在这里面
'Course you can. it’s all in there.

114
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,441
伯纳 这是我周末头等大事 怎么不早提?
This is my top priority reading. Why hasn't it been done before?

115
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,241
我也不知道 我提了几次了
I can't understand. I put it up several times

116
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,637
总是受到热烈欢迎
and it was always welcomed most warmly.

117
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,765
又总被更紧急的事挤掉
But there was always something more urgent on.

118
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,964
好 这回你找对人了 非常非常感谢
Well, you've come to the right place this time.

119
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,158
多谢 大臣
Thank you, Minister.

120
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,883
真是了不起 对吧伯纳?
This is marvellous, isn’t it, Bernard?

121
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,681
对吧 伯纳?
Isn't it, Bernard?

122
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,283
哦 是很...这个...
Oh, yes. Well, it’s... er...

123
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,803
确实...非常好看 大臣
That is, it’s... um... very well presented.

124
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:41,004
汉弗莱也会着迷的吧?      他马上就到
Humphrey will be fascinated. He's on his way here.

125
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:44,079
肯定会提意见的      什么意思 伯纳?
He'll give his views. What are you saying?

126
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,719
对 我说过 他八成会...
Yes, well, as I say, I think that he'll think

127
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,798
觉得这个...字打的很好
that it’s beautifully... typed.

128
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:55,521
啊 大臣      啊 汉弗莱 快进来
Ah, Minister. Ah, Humphrey, come in.

129
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,445
请坐      谢谢 大臣
Sit down. Thank you, Minister.

130
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:01,642
好吧 地方政府 我们要做点什么?
Now, local authorities. What are we gong to do?

131
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:07,043
大臣 这项新职能给您更多影响力 内阁资历
This new remit gives you more Influence, more Cabinet seniority.

132
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:10,199
可不用多为它费劲或者操心
But do not let it give you any more work or worry.

133
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,005
没那个必要
That would be foolishness.

134
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,126
汉弗莱 我们得马上制止那套铺张浪费
We've got to stop this appalling waste and extravagance.

135
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,126
为什么?
Why?

136
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,122
为什么?      对 为什么?
Why? Yes, why?

137
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,887
这是我的工作 我们是政府
Well, it’s my job. We're the government.

138
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:25,719
选我们是要我们执政的
We were elected to govern.

139
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,878
诚然 大臣
Oh, really, Minister.

140
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:32,558
不过 您当然不想干涉民选的
Surely you won't tamper with the democratic rights

141
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:35,480
地方代表的民主权力吧?
of freely-elected local representatives?

142
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,479
呃...当然不想
Well... no, of course not.

143
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:43,640
可地方政府不是民主 基层民主纯属胡闹
But local democracy's a farce!

144
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:46,640
大多数人不认得他们的委员是谁
Most people don't know who their councillor is.

145
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,002
地方选举里他们不投票
They never vote in a local election.

146
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,566
投的人也只当它是
Those who do regard it

147
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,161
中央政府的民意测验罢了
as a popularly poll for the government here.

148
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:56,046
地方政务委员会不对任何人负责
Local councillors are accountable to nobody.

149
00:08:56,207 --> 00:09:00,598
他们是热心公益的公民 无私奉献出业余时间
They're public-spirited citizens sacrificing spare time.

150
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,600
你见过他们吗?      不得已的时候见过
Ever met any? When there was no alternative.

151
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,407
一半人是好管闲事的自大狂
They're either busy bodies on an ego trip

152
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,240
另一半只想捞点好处
or in it for what they can get out of it.

153
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:13,843
也许他们该进下院
Perhaps they ought to be in the House of Commons.

154
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:17,761
我是说 去见识真正的官员怎么办事
I mean, to see how a proper legislative assembly behaves.

155
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,596
反正我要管管他们 我有个计划
I'm gong to get a grip on them. I have a plan.

156
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,041
您有个计划?
You have a plan?

157
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,806
对
Yes.

158
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,481
我要规定 任何地方官员
I'm gong to insist that any local official

159
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,956
上马新项目 预算超过...
who puts up a plan costing more than...

160
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:36,723
就说1万磅吧 必须制定衡量指标
say... 10,000 must accompany it with failure standards.

161
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,396
制定什么?
With what?

162
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,479
定个声明 说失败的标准
With a statement saying he will have failed

163
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,640
就是没能达到...既定目标...
If his project does not achieve certain... pre-set results...

164
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:51,801
或超过既定时间 人员 或预算限制
or exceeds... fixed time or staff or budget Limits.

165
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:56,165
这种危险的胡闹 您从哪里得来的?
Where did you get the idea for this dangerous nonsense?

166
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,443
从这个部...某员工
From someone... in the department.

167
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:01,644
大臣 我警告过您 和员工直接对话
I have warned you before about the danger of speaking

168
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,446
后患无穷
to people in the department!

169
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:08,122
我恳求您别踏进地方政府的地雷阵
I implore you to stay out of the minefield of local government.

170
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,879
这是政治坟场
It is a political graveyard.

171
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,765
对不起 汉弗莱爵士
Excuse me, Sir Humphrey,

172
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:15,044
地雷阵里不能建坟场
you cannot have a graveyard in a minefield

173
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,005
不然尸体会...
because all the corpses would... powww!

174
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,198
是你给我揽的权限 你说的
You got me this job, you said.

175
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,006
可我没指望您做什么实事
But I didn’t expect you to do anything.

176
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,364
您一向不做实事啊
I mean, you've never done anything before!

177
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,997
你的牢骚我一概不听      算我求您...
I am deaf to your complaints. Please, I beg you...

178
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,078
不行不行 汉弗莱
No, no, no, no, Humphrey.

179
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,602
我要求立即拟定详细建议
I want specific proposals straight away.

180
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,362
还有近期计划 马上就给地方执行
And immediate plans For their implementation.

181
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,722
真不知道你着什么急
What's the fuss about?

182
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:48,358
我只是要地方政府定指标 又不是要白厅
I'm only proposing for local government, not Whitehall.

183
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,245
不过话说回来...
Though come to think of it...

184
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:53,524
大臣 如果您非要干涉地方政府
If you insist on interfering in local government,

185
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,362
我能不能建议一个很刺激选票的角度?
may I make a suggestion that could prove a vote winner?

186
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,559
汉弗莱 我再不想听...
Humphrey, I want to hear no more about...

187
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,159
刺激选票?
Vote winner?

188
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,319
地方政府有个方面急需关注
An area of local government that needs urgent attention.

189
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,478
什么?      民防设施
What? Civil defence.

190
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:16,402
你说核掩体? 那纯粹是个笑话吧
You mean fallout shelters? Surely they're just a joke.

191
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,764
正是 大臣 眼下是个笑话
Precisely, Minister. At the moment, they are a joke.

192
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,122
被地方官员拖着后腿 可是
Local authorities are dragging their feet,

193
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,323
任何政府的最高职能
but the highest duty of any government

194
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,682
莫过于保护人民
Is to protect its citizens.

195
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,556
有人说建造掩体让核战争更可能发生了
Some think building shelters makes nuclear war more likely.

196
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,161
有核武器 当然得有核掩体
If you have the weapons, you need the shelters.

197
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,080
有时我怀疑我们要核武器干嘛
Sometimes wonder why we need the weapons.

198
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:39,125
大臣 您不是片面限武派吧?
Minister, you're not a unilateralist?

199
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,482
这个...我也说不好
Well... I sometimes wonder.

200
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:45,242
那您得赶紧辞掉公职
Then you must resign from the government!

201
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:50,720
啊 没有没有 还没到那个地步
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not that unilateralist.

202
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,720
不过美国会替我们防备俄国的吧
America will protect us from the Russians.

203
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,838
俄国 谁提俄国了?
Who's talking about the Russians?

204
00:11:56,007 --> 00:12:00,046
独立核威慑...      那是防备法国的
Well, the independent deterrent. its against the French!

205
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,564
法国?
The French?

206
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,477
真是骇人听闻      怎么?
But that's astounding! Why?

207
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:12,037
他们是盟国 是友邦啊      眼下是
Well, they're our allies, our partners. They are now.

208
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:16,041
可过去900年 他们一直跟我们作对
But they've been our enemies for most of the past 900 years.

209
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:19,597
他们有核弹 我们也得有
If they've got the bomb, we must have the bomb!

210
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:24,682
如果是防法国 对啊 这就说通了
If it’s for the French, Makes a lot of sense.

211
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:28,681
对啊 法国佬信不过      可不是
Yes. Can't trust the Frogs. You can say that again!

212
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,839
不过 公众越来越担心核弹
There is increasing public concern about the bomb.

213
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,919
如果他们看见我在这块出力...
If I were to be seen to be doling something about it...

214
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,443
对啊 我明白你的意思了
I see what you mean.

215
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:41,725
路德维克肯尼迪要做一个BBC民防纪录片
Ludovic Kennedy is preparing a BBC documentary on civil defence

216
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,685
大概会批评现状
likely to be critical of the current situation.

217
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,600
可如果您在采取决定性措施...
If you were seen to be taking decisive measures...

218
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,564
对 正是
Right, yes.

219
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:53,638
阿路总被我玩得团团转
I always handle Ludo so frightfully well.

220
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:58,802
好吧 从哪里入手?      大臣 我有个建议
Right, well, where do we start? Just a suggestion.

伦敦泰晤士沼自治市

222
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,523
比全国各地区民防花销都要少

223
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,042
来个部门级视察怎样?
A ministerial visit, do you think?

224
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:10,358
是本斯坦利那个市 一撇小胡子那个?
That's Ben Stanley's borough, with the wispy moustache,

225
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,006
媒体公敌?
who the press all hate.

226
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,601
有道理 伯纳 马上去安排
Good point. Get onto it straight away.

227
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:18,316
让比尔通知到所有媒体

你能从白厅空降下来

00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,842
教训我们怎么管理自治市?

235
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,038
我没从白厅空降下来
I'm not swanning down from Whitehall.

236
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:52,677
我只问你 为什么不像全国其他市

那样保护选出你的人民?

238

简单 没钱嘛      没钱去找啊?

00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:04,320
好主意 停掉学校午餐 不买教科书?
Oh, that's great! Stop school meals, buy no textbooks?

Turn OAPs out into the cold? I can tell you where to find it.

You can? Yes.

242
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:13,083
告诉他 卡赖特博士
Tell him, Dr Cartwright.

243
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:18,405
你们可以取消计划中的新展馆
Scrap the plans for the new exhibition centre

244
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,684

年度支出
Revenue account.

256
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,282
太荒唐了      怎么?
That's just stupid! Why?

257
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:06,599
这是对弱势群体基础服务的剥削
Well, it’s depriving the disadvantaged of indispensable services!

258
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:12,000
涡流泳池?      我不在乎有没有钱建掩体
Jacuzzi pools? I don't care if we can afford a shelter.

259
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:16,479
我们是片面限武市 不相信核战争
This is a unilateralist borough. We do not believe in nuclear war.

260
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,478
斯坦利先生 我也不相信核战争
I don't believe in it either,

261
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,115
但核掩体是政府政策

262
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,323

Excuse me, Minister. I think you may be interested in...

斯坦利先生 看来归根结底
Mr Stanley, it appears that you would not be

272
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,401
您是壮烈牺牲不了啦
called upon to make the supreme sacrifice.

273
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,924
怎么讲?      这市政厅下头有个掩体吧?
What do you mean? Is there a shelter under the town hall?

274

是吗?
Well, is there?

275
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:15,126
不是我们建的      你们也没拆
We didn’t build it! You maintain it.

276
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:20,560
又挺小的      里面有你的位置吧?
it’s only a small one. And there is a place in it for you?

277
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:23,639
我勉为其难地接受劝告
I was persuaded, with deep reluctance,

278
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,560
认为保护我自己至关重要

00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:30,197
符合本市全体纳税人的利益
in the interests of the ratepayers of Thames Marsh.

你为别的重要人员做了哪些防范呢?

医生 护士 急救队 消防员
Doctors, nurses, firemen.

282
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:40,081
那些人重要性恐怕不比委员差?
People who might be almost as important as councillors.

283
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,642
有个委员是搞化学的
One of them's a chemist!

284
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:46,806
好啊 核难临头 阿司匹林最有用了
Great. Nothing like aspirin for the nuclear holocaust.

285
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:53,363
你那位在泰晤士沼出尽了风头吧?
Your chap had a publicly triumph down at Thames Marsh.

286
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:54,880
是啊 大获全胜
Oh, yes, tremendous.

287
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,836
你倒不怎么替他高兴 小汉
You don't sound appropriately happy for him.

288
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,805
问题在于 他自以为有了成就
Trouble is he thinks he's achieved something.

289
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,002
太好了
Splendid.

290
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:06,638
大臣自以为有成就 日子就好过多了
Life is easier if ministers think they achieved something.

291
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,401
不闹腾 不发脾气
Stops them fretting. No tantrums.

292
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:13,046
对 可他现在要实施第二项构想
Now he wants to introduce his next idea.

293
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:14,959
一个大臣有两项构想
A minister with two ideas.

294
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:18,005
还真是前无古人呢
I can't remember when we last had one of those.

295
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,598
哦 不是他自己想的
Oh, it’s not his own.

296
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,962
他想设定衡量指标
He wants to introduce failure standards

297
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,516
评估所有1万磅以上的地方项目
on all council contracts over10,000

298
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,082
还要指明一名官员负责
and make a named official responsible.

299
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:31,879
汉弗莱      我知道
Humphrey! I know.

300
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:35,642
又是那个卡赖特的胡话 还以为戈登消灭掉了
Cartwright’s idiot scheme! I thought Gordon had squashed it.

301
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,519
他跑来找我们了
He's come over to us now.

302
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:40,724
秘密跟大臣勾兑
Slipped the scheme to the minister privately,

303
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,161
牛皮纸袋 私相授受
under plain cover!

304
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,527
你知道这会轮到我们吧 一旦你预先
It'll be us next. Once you specify in advance

305
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,757
给一个项目既定目标
what a project's supposed to achieve

306
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:51,044
还有责任人负责
and whose responsibility it is to see that it does,

307
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,925
整个体制将毁于一旦
the entire system collapses.

308
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,477
你就掉进了专业管理的泥潭
You're into the squalid world of professional management.

309
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:59,002
对 我全力向他解释了
I know. I've tried to explain to him.

310
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:02,358
我反复告诉他 他的新职责
I have pointed out that his new responsibilities

311
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,678
是用来享受的 不是劳心劳力的 我不明白
were for enjoying, not exercising. I don't know.

312
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:08,566
我们每隔两三年就把官员轮一圈
We move our officials round every 2 or3 years

313
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,446
就是要避免这种个人责任的废话
to stop this personal responsibility nonsense.

314
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,997
若真实现 今后每两周都得调动了
If this happened, we'd be posting everybody once a fortnight.

315
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,558
得拦住他 他下一站去哪出风头?
He must be stopped. What's his next little publicly trip?

316
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:24,164
明天他要把这次胜利重温一遍
Well, tomorrow he’s living his little triumph over again.

317
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:27,558
跟路德维克肯尼迪录电视采访
He's recording a TV interview with Ludovic Kennedy.

318
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,797
民防的纪录片
A documentary on civil defence.

319
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,798
也许他该拿到份档案
Supposing he had a dossier

320
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:36,357
里头写着地方政务委员
on the curious ways in which local councillors

321
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:39,121
如何胡花国防预算
spend their civil defence budgets.

322
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:42,518
那有什么用?      我有个构想
How would that help? I've got an idea.

323
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,724
也许你该去当大臣
Perhaps you ought to become a minister!

324
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,561
开玩笑的 阿诺德
Um... just a joke, Arnold.

325
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,045
预备 演播室准备开机
Stand by, studio. We're about to record.

326
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,675
真少见 肯尼迪先生 大臣也有机会
A change for a minister to be given a chance

327
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,202
谈谈成功的事了
to talk about something that's a success.

328
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:04,406
在BBC里太少见了 政策变了吗?
Most unusual for the BBC. Is this a change of policy?

329
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,444
...2...1
...2... 1.

330
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,279
大臣 您最近一直声称
You've been claiming recently

331
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,802
您和地方政府的交往中
that in your dealings with local authority,

332
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,118
民防方面有了些成就
you've been making progress as regards civil defence.

333
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:18,405
不过这恐怕是夸大宣传吧?
Surely this has been more in publicly than achievement?

334
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,762
没有没有 阿路
No, no, no, no, Ludo.

335
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,442
当局已经被迫直面问题了
Authorities are being made to face up to these issues

336
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:27,400
正因为我们掀起的公众兴趣
because of the interest we have generated.

337
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,242
你同意了 你的成就是宣传上的
You're agreeing. Your success has been a publicly success.

338
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:34,200
这么说也对 可实质改变也在进行
Well, yes, but things are changing.

339
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:38,645
泰晤士沼如何了?      泰晤士沼 好例子
Well, what about Thames Marsh? Ah, Thames Marsh

340
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,765
我跟媒体说过 他们只有一个掩体
As I said in the press, they have one shelter.

341
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:45,283
专门留给本斯坦利 市政委员长
A place in it is reserved for Ben Stanley, council leader,

342
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,120
他拒绝给其他人修掩体
who refuses to build shelters for others.

343
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,278
这是不是有点伪善呢?
Don't you think that's hypocritical?

344
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:52,597
理所当然 大臣 可以指望
Surely it’s reasonable to expect

345
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:56,601
一位民选代表有机会幸存下来吧
that one of our elected representatives should survive.

346
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,482
不然谁来执政?      在核灾难之中
Who is to govern otherwise? In the event of a nuclear holocaust

347
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,680
当然 我们都企盼它永不发生
and, of course, we all pray that such a thing will never happen

348
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:09,045
也许有些人比政客更重要
there are perhaps more important people than mere politicians.

349
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,324
医生 护士 急救队 等等
Doctors, nurses, ambulance men, and so on.

350
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,762
从事基础服务的人
All people who run essential services.

351
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,440
可是据我所知 大臣
Correct me if I'm wrong,

352
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:19,917
首相本人和内政大臣
but is it not a fact that the PM and Home Secretary

353
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,636
不也在政府掩体里留有位置吗?
have places reserved for them in government fallout shelters?

354
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,683
这完全是两码事
That is completely different.

355
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,204
怎讲?
How

356
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:34,565
这个 总得有人管理...你看...
Well, there has to be someone to... run the... you know.

357
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:37,036
大臣 您刚刚说政客
Minister, you're saying political leaders

358
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:40,119
应该把位置让给医生护士
should give up their places for doctors and nurses.

359
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:44,121
这个观点您向首相和内政大臣提了吗?
Have you put this idea to the PM and the Home Secretary

360
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:47,359
我认为我们切不可把重要问题
I think we ought to be careful not to trivialise

361
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,995
简单化 路德维克
what is a very serious Issue, Ludovic.

362
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,439
我再举个例子
I'll give you another example.

363
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,121
我刚听说 有个市的委员
I know of a borough which sent councillors,

364
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:00,041
拿着纳税人的钱 去加州考察掩体
at the ratepayers' expensive, to California to look at shelters.

365
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,442
但考察回来却无事可做
But they couldn't do anything about it

366
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,360
因为整个三年的民防预算
because they'd spent the entire civil defence budget

367
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:08,121
都在旅行中花光了
for three whole years on the trip!

368
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,242
真让人震惊      震惊
How shocking. Shocking.

369
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:17,162
谢谢 大臣 对了 节目录的怎样?
Thank you, Minister. By the way, how did the recording go?

370
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:21,360
本斯坦利的掩体问题有点麻烦
Well, I got into a bit of bother over Ben Stanley's bunker.

371
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:25,202
我说政客没有医生重要 之类之类
I said politicians weren't as important as doctors and so on.

372
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:26,806
是吗?
Did you?

373
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,588
于是他问
Then he said

374
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:33,279
"首相的政府掩体又怎么说?"
"What about the PM's place in the government shelter?"

375
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,644
您说什么?      当然 我岔开了
And what did you say? I got out of it.

376
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,798
还满巧妙的
Quite cleverly, actually.

377
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:41,960
就是不知道首相会不会高兴
I'm not too sure how happy the PM will be about it.

378
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:45,722
然后我又想起一件妙事 一群市政委员
Then I recovered with a marvellous story about some councillors

379
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,481
跑到加州去考察掩体
who went to California to look at shelters

380
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,676
游山玩水 花掉了
and spent three entire years of

381
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,358
三年的民防预算
the civil defence budget on the jaunt!

382
00:21:56,327 --> 00:22:00,320
能否问下这例子哪来的?      对 哪来的?
May I ask where that came from? Yes. Where did that come from?

383
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,557
民防理事会简报里的 大臣
From the Civil Defence Directorate.

384
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,116
他们一定听说了您要上节目
They knew you were doling the interview.

385
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:10,640
好吧 大臣 您当然知道您在干什么
Oh, well. Anyway, Minister, I'm sure you know what you're doling.

386
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:13,783
汉弗莱 你只在
Humphrey... you only say that

387
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:16,959
我大难临头的时候才这么说
when I've made an appalling cock-up.

388
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:21,281
大臣您知道 那个市里
You do know the borough in question

389
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,599
有首相的选区
contains the PM's constituency...

390
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,437
而首相的选举助理
and that the PM's election agent

391
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,360
正是那个代表团团长?
was the councillor who led the delegation?

392
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,524
这是开玩笑吧?
That was just a joke, wasn't it?

393
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:40,440
10号把消息压了几个星期 不过
Number 10 have been trying to keep it quiet.

394
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:43,804
算了 纸包不住火啊      别 别
Oh, well, truth will out. No, no, no!

395
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:49,087
不行 绝不能捅出去 会被当成人身攻击的
No, no, no, it mustn't out. It might look like a personal attack.

396
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,920
你知道首相对忠诚多敏感
You know what the PM's like about loyalty.

397
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,078
汉弗莱 这个访谈绝不能播
This interview must not go out.

398
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:58,280
可惜啊大臣 我没时间 我得走了
Well, unfortunately, I haven't the time, I must be gong.

399
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:03,157
汉弗莱 我...我命令你 汉弗莱
Humphrey, I... I... I... I'm ordering you, Humphrey.

400
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:07,320
唉 正是您命令我走的啊      怎么?
Alas, your orders are calling me away. What do you mean?

401
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,045
您的计划 设立
Your scheme for imposing

402
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:12,279
地方政府衡量指标 这太复杂
failure standards on local councils is very complex.

403
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,722
您要求马上拿出计划
You asked for proposals straight away.

404
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,037
让我一刻也不得闲
It's taking every moment of my time.

405
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,402
要帮忙也有心无力了
Much as I would like to help.

406
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,643
话说回来 如果衡量指标的事
However... if implementing failure standards

407
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:26,957
不催那么急...
were not quite so urgent...

408
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:29,800
你是说 你能拦下电视节目?
You mean, you can stop this broadcast?

409
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:33,562
大臣 我们不能审查BBC
Now, Minister, we cannot censor the BBC,

410
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:37,561
不过我刚好要和他们政策部主任吃午餐
but I happen to be lunching with the BBC's Director Policy.

411
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:41,606
也许您愿意一起来      可要是不能审查...
Perhaps you'd care to join us. But if we can't censor them...

412
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:45,760
我们可以让他们自动自发撤掉它
We could persuade them to withdraw programmes voluntarily

413
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:49,602
只要证明播出节目有悖公众利益
once they realise that transmission Is not in the public interest.

414
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,442
当然有悖我的利益...
Well, it’s not in my interest...

415
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:56,522
而我代表公众 所以就有悖公众利益
and I represent the public, so it’s not in the public interest.

416
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,958
这理由倒很有创意
That's a novel argument.

417
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:07,602
还真没对他们用过 对吧?
We haven't tried that on them before. Have we?

418
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:12,397
抱歉 哈克先生 BBC不会向政府压力低头
The BBC cannot give in to government pressure.

419
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:15,365
这事先放着好吗      不 别
Let's leave that on one side... No, no!

420
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:19,839
这事先放着好吗? 拜托 大臣
Let's leave that on one side, shall we? Please, Minister.

421
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,237
弗兰克 能再问件事吗?
Frank, could I raise something else?

422
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,837
有很多人在担心
There is considerable disquiet

423
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,716
BBC对政府的敌对态度
about the BBC's attitude and hostility towards the government.

424
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,564
纯粹胡说八道      真的吗?
But that's absurd. Is it?

425
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:36,117
他们记录了BBC近来
They've been documenting Instances of bias

426
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,562
报道中的偏见
in BBC current affairs.

427
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,560
瞒报有利新闻
Favourable news stoles not reported.

428
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,319
对了 刻意夸大
Oh, yes. Excessive publicly

429
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:47,285
外国的反英论点
for other countries' cases against Britain.

430
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:50,280
尤其是我们的共同市场敌人...
Especially our Common Market enemies...

431
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:54,245
呃 盟友
...um... partners.

432
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,398
哦 对了
Oh, yes.

433
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:59,400
针对首相的笑话
Jokes against the Prime Minister.

434
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:03,242
过分宣传反政府示威
Unnecessary publicly For anti-government demonstrations.

435
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:07,759
大臣们提出的被拒掉的节目
And ministers' programme suggestions not accepted.

436
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:12,200
恐怕其它的我包里放不下了
I had no room in my case for the others.

437
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,006
可我们当然对这些都有答复的
I'm sure we have answers to all these.

438
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,159
BBC总有答复 傻不傻另当别论
The BBC's always got answers. Silly ones.

439
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:21,046
当然 公平起见 我还得警告你
Yes, of course. I thought it fair to warn you

440
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,959
有人提了些问题
that questions are being asked.

441
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:27,480
什么问题?      比如说
What sort of questions? Well, for example,

442
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:29,757
国会的电视直播
were Parliament to be televised,

443
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:32,680
是不是应该委托给独立电视台
whether it shouldn't be entrusted to ITV.

444
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:38,638
开玩笑吧?      还有BBC行政部门
You can't be serious? And whether the BBC administration

445
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:41,082
有没有在削减人员和场所经费
Is making the cuts in jobs and premises

446
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,203
跟我们政府里一样
that we’ve endured in government.

447
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:46,962
要不要组建委员会审查BBC的收支?
Should a select committee scrutinise BBC expenditure?

448
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:50,642
这是无法容忍的侵略      可不是
That would be an intolerable intrusion. Well, of course.

449
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:53,725
还有包厢也是个大问题
Then there's this extraordinary matter of boxes

450
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,447
赛马会 网球场 剧院 音乐会
at Ascot, Wimbledon, Lords, Covent Garden.

451
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:00,366
对 这是工作需要
Ah, yes, those are a technical requirement

452
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:03,121
节目制作和播出人员必须得有
for the production and engineering staff.

453
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,925
国税局的报告显示
Reports from the inland Revenue suggest

454
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:09,442
这些制作和播出人员
that the production and engineering staff

455
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,962
都举着香槟酒杯
are all holding champagne glasses.

456
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:16,477
身边陪伴的是他们的妻子...
And are all accompanied by their wives or...

457
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:20,686
或者同等地位的女士
ladles of... equal distinction.

458
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,195
而且都长的异常类似
And all bear a remarkable similarly

459
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,961
贵公司理事 董事和经理
to governors, directors and executives

460
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:30,687
还有他们的朋友们
of the Corporation, and their friends.

461
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:33,361
看看 你这张照的不错
Oh, I say, you've come out very well.

462
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,757
当然 我们有可能容忍这些批评
It is possible we can contain all this criticism,

463
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,680
只要事态不进一步扩大
provided the files don't get any larger.

464
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:45,355
我劝我们大臣说 没有必要
I've urged my minister that there's no need

465
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:48,087
正式处理民防部门的事
to take up the civil defence issue formally.

466
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,966
可...可你要看到我的位置
But... But you must see my position.

467
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:56,966
BBC不会向政府压力低头
The BBC can't give in to government pressure.

468
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,640
当然 我们也不要他们低头 是吧大臣
We wouldn’t want them to.

469
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,082
不要吗?      当然不要
Wouldn’t we? No, of course not.

470
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,761
不过 大臣和路德维克肯尼迪的访谈
The minister’s interview with Ludovic Kennedy

471
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,645
其中有些事实错误
did contain factual errors.

472
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,718
事实错误? 那就不一样了
Factual errors? That's different.

473
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,401
当然 BBC不会向政府压力低头
The BBC couldn't give in to government pressure.

474
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,602
当然不会
Absolutely not.

475
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:15,043
可报道准确性对我们至关重要
But we set great store by factual accuracy.

476
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:19,200
其中有些信息 播出时可能会过时
Some of the information might well be out of date by the time...

477
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:22,086
过时? 啊 这就严重了
Out of date? Ah, now, that's serious.

478
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:25,205
显然 BBC不会向政府压力低头
Obviously, the BBC couldn't give in to government pressure.

479
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:26,356
哦 确实不会
Oh, indeed not.

480
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:29,644
但我们绝不能播过时的东西
But we can't transmit out-of-date material.

481
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:34,039
录影之后 我还意识到我泄漏了一两处
And since the recording, I realised that I made one or two slips

482
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,926
可能算机密的信息
that might have security implications.

483
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,443
比如?      他不能告诉你
Such as? He can't tell you what they are.

484
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,920
为什么?      机密
Why not? Security.

485
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,078
对机密 怎么小心都不为过
Can't be too careful about security.

486
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:52,001
涉及国家安全问题 我们得负起责任来
If the defence of the realm is at stake, we must be responsible.

487
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:55,961
显然 BBC不会向政府压力低头
Obviously, the BBC couldn't give in to government pressure,

488
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,522
可机密 怎么小心都不为过
but security, you can't be too careful.

489
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,082
不为过      不为过
Can't be too careful. Can't be too careful.

490
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:03,801
如果有准确性和机密问题
If there are inaccuracies and security worries,

491
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,481
BBC就不会播放它了
the BBC wouldn’t want to put the interview out.

492
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:11,084
正是      情况就完全改观了
Precisely. That puts a different complexion on it.

493
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:14,284
播出节目有悖公众利益
Transmission would not be in the public’s interest,

494
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:17,007
但有件事我得说清楚
but I must make one thing absolutely clear.

495
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,123
这个问题丝毫没有疑问
There can be absolutely no question

496
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:23,041
BBC不会向政府压力低头
of the BBC ever giving in to government pressure.

497
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,516
好消息 大臣
Oh, good news, Minister.

498
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,515
BBC决定不播出
The BBC have decided not to send out

499
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,996
您和路德维克肯尼迪的访谈      真的?
your interview with Ludovic Kennedy.

500
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,920
他们决定这才是明智之举
They felt that was the responsible course.

501
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,078
干的漂亮      这没什么 大臣
Well done. Oh, it was nothing.

502
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:40,239
不过 我还是有种感觉
Yet, you know, I can't help feeling

503
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,637
有人在陷害我 诱我说出
that I was trapped into saying those things

504
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,877
对首相不利的言论
that might’ve embarrassed the PM.

505
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:47,883
不会吧?      真的
Surely not? Yes.

506
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,245
我觉得我上了大当了
I think I was dropped right in it.

507
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,677
您怎么能这样胡思乱想?
How could you think such a ridiculous thought?

508
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:59,079
胡思乱想 汉弗莱? 他不会陷害我吗?
Why is it ridiculous to imagine that he would've tried to trap me?

509
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:00,921
谁?
Who?

510
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,040
路德维克肯尼迪
Ludovic Kennedy.

511
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:08,720
哦 路德维克肯尼迪陷害您 那当然
Oh, Ludovic Kennedy tried to trap you. Yes, well, I'm sure he did.

512
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,526
骗子手 一等一级阴险小人 绝对信不过
Deceitful crowd, the medal. Underhand.

513
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,439
对 完全是小人
No, thoroughly deceitful.

514
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:17,919
对了 我想地方政务委员会的事还是算了
By the way, I think it might be wise to lay off the local councils.

515
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,406
哦 是吗?
Oh, yes?

516
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:22,415
反正 委员们大体上还是
After all, councillors are responsible,

517
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:25,164
讲道理又负责的
sensible people on the whole.

518
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:27,319
而且是民主选举出的      民主选举
And they are democratically elected. Democratically elected.

519
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:30,001
说真的 中央政府必须万分小心
Central government must be frightfully careful

520
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,476
不能越权给他们乱下指示
before it tells them how to do their jobs.

521
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:36,720
万分小心 衡量指标的事呢?
Frightfully careful. And the failure standards?

522
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:41,085
我看也是一个道理 你说呢?
Well, I think the same applies... don't you?

523
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,839
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
