00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,220
机会均等

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:47,161
就象我说的 凯西 首相想要我加入内阁
So, Kathy, the Prime Minister saw fit to invite one into the Cabinet

6
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,557
我就进来了
and, well, here one is.

7
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:51,718
责任很重大吧?
Isn't it a terrific responsibility?

8
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:56,720
依我看 一个人选择毕生为公众服务
I suppose, if one chooses to dedicate one's life to public service,

9
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:59,321
就要担起这份责任
responsibility is something one accepts.

10
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:03,275
权力很大啊      我知道 我知道
But all this power! I know, I know!

11
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:07,440
有时让人受宠若惊 但又让人谦卑自省
Frightening sometimes. But it also makes one very humble.

12
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:12,601
一旦坐在首相府 内阁会议桌前 顿时发现...
Sits at the Cabinet table, Number 10 Downing Street and realises

13
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,758
伯纳打电话来 谦卑的人
Bernard rang, O humble one.

14
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:18,476
下议院要你看BBC二台
Central House want you to watch a programme on BBC2.

15
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,242
莫琳沃金 国会议员 后座议员之一
Maureen Watkins, MP. One of the backbench MPs.

16
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:27,800
我不太喜欢她 整天喊女权 算了我不看 别写进去
A rampaging feminist. I wont bother. Don't write that down.

17
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:33,360
我喜欢她 您不觉得女性仍然是弱势群体?
I like her. Don't you think that women are still the exploited sex?

18
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:38,282
我们全班都觉得女性在单位被剥削 在家被剥削
All of us in 5B think that women are exploited at work and at home

19
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:43,441
整个社会被男性主导 运行 男性为所欲为
it's a world designed and run by men for men's convenience.

20
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:48,239
就象她说的      现在肯定不会了
Like SHE says. Not any longer, surely?

21
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:52,685
她在下院没分量      当然 那被男人占据了
She doesn't carry any weight in the House. No, it's full of men.

22
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:59,124
多谢了安妮 还要问什么吗?      最后一个问题
Thank you. Anything else you'd like to ask? Just one last question.

23
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:03,803
作为执掌大权的大臣 您有什么个人成就?
As a minister, what have you personally achieved?

24
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,686
成就? 很多啦
Achieved? Oh, well, all sorts of things.

25
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,556
枢密院席位 党内政策委员会...
Membership of the Privy Council, the Party Policy Committee...

26
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,436
不 你做的实事 有惠于人民的
No, things you've done that makes life better for other people.

27
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:18,006
有惠于?      对
Makes life better? Yes.

28
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:21,876
其他人? 当然有很多了
For other people? There must be a number of things.

29
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:26,598
这就是职责所在嘛 一天18个小时 没有双休日
That's what one's job is all about. 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.

30
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,878
可以举个事例吗?
Could you give me examples?

31
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,039
不然写出来很无聊的      事例
Makes it a bit boring otherwise. Examples.

32
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:38,201
不知道从哪说起 太多政府的协同决策了
Where to start. So much of government is collective decisions.

33
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,202
我们聚到一起 整个国家最出色的头脑 群策群力
All of us together, best minds in the country, hammering it out.

34
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:47,519
但什么让你回想往事的时候 骄傲的说"我做的"
But what will you look back on afterwards and say "I did that."

35
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:51,475
就象作家回顾自己的作品一样
You know, like a writer can look at his books.

36
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:56,482
政府是个精密的机器 人们各执一词
Government is a complex business people have to have their say.

37
00:02:56,647 --> 00:03:02,244
都需要时间 罗马不是一天建成的...是现在吗?
Take time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Is that the time?

38
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:05,877
我得看电视节目 失陪了
I really must be getting my boxes. Excuse me.

39
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:09,039
谢谢      非常感谢
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

40
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:14,406
跟你聊天真有意思 写出来给我审阅一下 可以吗?
Such fun this little talk. Let me approve the article, as we agreed?

41
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,558
拜      拜
Bye. Bye.

42
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,359
小大人
Bright kid.

43
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:29,317
再也不接受校报采访了 她问的问题太难了
Last interview for a school magazine. She asked difficult questions.

44
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:34,277
只是天真而已 她觉得你凭良心做事
She assumed there was some moral basis to your activities.

45
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,200
当然了      喔 吉姆 别傻了!
Well, there is. Oh, Jim, don't be silly!

46
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,156
你叹什么气?
What are you sighing for?

47
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,918
我没叹气
I'm not sighing.

48
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:54,323
说来听听      我有什么成就? 她问得对
Out with it. Well, what have I achieved? She's right.

49
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:58,196
你还真谦卑起来啦      我一条法案都没通过
It really does make you humble! I can't get any bills through.

50
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:02,565
还有两年就要卸任了      改革公务员系统
The time's taken up for the next two years. Reform the Civil Service.

51
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,922
不可能的 是个怪圈      为什么
Impossible. Catch 22. Why?

52
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:10,002
就算我提出50条重大改革 谁来实施它们?
I suggested 50 terrific reforms, who would have to implement them?

53
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,158
公务员系统
(BOTH) The Civil Service.

54
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,636
这样 我跟你说
All right, I tell you what.

55
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,401
不要50个改革 一个就够了
Not 50 reforms, just one.

56
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,566
哼 什么?
Huh! What?

57
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:23,117
完成一项重大改革 你就很了不起了
If you achieve one import reform, that'd be something.

58
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,279
我会载入史册 你有什么建议?
Get me in the record books! What do you suggest?

59
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:29,120
多提拔女性进入高层
Make them put more women into top jobs.

60
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:33,485
女性占人口的一半 也应该占常任秘书的一半
Half the population Should be half the Permanent Secretaries.

61
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,640
高层有多少女性?      不是很多
How many women are there at the top? Not many.

62
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,275
机会均等
Equal opportunities.

63
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:45,077
值得一试 不管怎样 这是原则问题
I'll have a go. After all, there's a principle at stake.

64
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,319
你要全凭原则做一些实事?
You're going to do something out of pure principle?

65
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,364
对      喔 吉姆
Yes. Oh, Jim.

66
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,882
原则问题最刺激选票
Principles are excellent vote winners.

67
00:04:56,687 --> 00:05:00,726
我们什么都不用做?      不用 第一第二段有误
We don't have to do anything? No. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are wrong.

68
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,606
其他都规定好了 不能改
And all the other points are covered.

69
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:07,760
我不需要做决定 还不用道歉
I don't have to make a decision. I don't even have to apologise.

70
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,646
能帮我拟一份回复吗?      已经完成了
Can you do a reply for me? Done it.

71
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:15,198
太好了 你这样的副秘书怎么这么少呢?
Fantastic. Why don't they make more Under-Secretaries like you?

72
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,642
还有别的事吗 大臣?      没了
Anything else, Minister? No.

73
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:23,086
告诉我 莎拉 高级公务员里有多少位女性?
How many women are there at the top of the Civil Service?

74
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:27,081
常任秘书里没有 150位常务副秘书里有4位
No Permanent Secretaries. Four out of 150 Deputy Secretaries.

75
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,842
你这一级 副秘书里呢?      27位女性
What about your grade? Under-Secretary? There are 27 of us.

76
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,805
好像还可以 一共多少人?      578人
Doesn't sound too bad. Out of how many? 578.

77
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:40,920
太不像话了 你没想法吗?     还行吧 觉得很滑稽
But that's appalling! Aren't you appalled? I find it comic.

78
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:46,844
不过公务员工作本来就滑稽 男人控制的嘛
But then I find most of the Civil Service comic. It's run by men

79
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,687
你能做什么 我能做什么?
What can you? What can I do?

80
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,838
您说真的 大臣?      对
Are you serious, Minister? Yes.

81
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:58,365
很简单 把各行各业的精英女性招进来
Bring top women from the professions, Straight into the top grades.

82
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:04,682
工资高 假期长 养老金 会有出色人选的
The pay is good for women. You'd get high-quality applicants.

83
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,680
他们能胜任?      当然能
And they could do the job? Of course.

84
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:11,681
恕我直言 一个报业议员可以晋升大臣
With respect, if you can make a journalist MP into a minister,

85
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:16,841
高级律师怎么就不能当副秘书?
why not make a partner from a legal firm into an Under-Secretary?

86
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:21,205
再说了 这的工作两个初中文凭就可以胜任
Most of the work here only needs about two O-levels, anyway.

87
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:26,355
有道理 莎拉 十分感谢      谢谢 大臣
Good point. Sarah, thank you very much. Thank you, Minister.

88
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,439
你叫我 大臣?      伯纳 莎拉告诉我...
You rang, Minister? Bernard, Sarah told...

89
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,997
什么 大臣?      没人的时候就叫我吉姆
Yes, Minister? I wish you'd call me Jim when we're alone.

90
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,965
我会记住的 大臣
Oh, I'll try to remember that, Minister.

91
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:44,199
莎拉告诉我这个申诉没道理
Sarah tells me this complaint is nonsense.

92
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:48,326
很好 我们可以CGSM了它      CGSM?
Oh, fine. So we can CGSM it. CGSM?

93
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:53,242
公务员术语 意思是"老年鞋厂委托书"
Civil service code. Consignment of Geriatric Shoe Manufacturers.

94
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,641
一大堆无用功 大臣
Load of old cobblers, Minister.

95
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:04,997
我不是公务员 我有我的术语 我写"转圜否决"
I shall use my own code. I shall write "round objects".

96
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,125
大臣 您要讨论员工问题?
Ah, Minister, you wanted a word about staffing?

97
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,279
没错 汉弗莱      早安 伯纳
Yes, Humphrey. Morning, Bernard.

98
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,438
我制订了一项新政
I've made a policy decision.

99
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:22,123
我要在公务员中女性数量上做文章
I'm going to change the number of women in the Civil Service.

100
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,881
反正数量也不多
Surely there aren't all that many.

101
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,443
问题就在这里      大臣觉得要多招一些
That's my point. The Minister thinks we need more.

102
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,404
多招很多      很多?
Many more. More?

103
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:37,881
打字员 清洁工 茶点工都满员了 你觉得呢 伯纳?
We're up to establishment on typists and tea ladies. Any ideas?

104
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:43,644
我们临时秘书人手不够      我在说常任秘书
Short on temporary secretaries. I'm talking Permanent Secretaries.

105
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:47,760
常任...      需要一批女官(又意甜橙)
Permanent... We need female mandarins.

106
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,918
那是无籽芦柑 大臣
Sort of satsumas, Minister.

107
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,796
坐下好吗 伯纳
Sit down, will you, Bernard.

108
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,004
常任秘书有多少人?      41个
How many Permanent Secretaries are there? 41, I believe.

109
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:02,160
其中有多少女性呢?      呃 基本上说...
And how many of those are women? Well, broadly speaking...

110
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,000
手上没有数据 我不好说
Not having the figures to hand, I'm not sure.

111
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,635
大约呢      大约...没有
Approximately. Approximately... none.

112
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:14,081
没有 我们有大约150位副秘书 多少女性?
There are about 150 Deputy Secretaries. How many are women?

113
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:16,477
这很难说      为什么?
Well, it's difficult to say. Why?

114
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,559
有很多男人婆婆妈妈的
There's a lot of old women among the men.

115
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,843
4位      这么多啊?
Four. Are there really?

116
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:30,001
我要宣布女性副秘书和常任秘书增加到25%
A quota of 25% women Deputy and Permanent Secretaries

117
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,158
四年内完成
to be achieved in four years.

118
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:36,923
等一等 大臣 我肯定赞成你的提议
Wait. I'm obviously in total sympathy with your objectives.

119
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:40,045
肯定的      当然我们需要更多女性
Obviously. Of course we must have more women.

120
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:44,564
肯定的 我们都很关心性别不平等问题
Of course! We are deeply concerned by this apparent imbalance,

121
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,718
但这些事要花时间的
but these things take time.

122
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:50,084
我希望马上着手      我举双手同意
I want to make a start straight away. I agree.

123
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:54,718
就从设立部门协调委员会入手...
I propose we setting up an inter-departmental committee...

124
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:58,436
不不不 你知道我不是这个意思
No, no, no. That's not what I meant and you know it.

125
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:02,964
不许拖延 要手持大锤 果断斩乱麻
This needs a sledgehammer. We must cut through the red tape.

126
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:08,042
大锤不能斩乱麻...      你知道我的意思
You can't cut tape with a sledgehammer... You know what I mean.

127
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:12,246
大臣 你误会我了 我没有要拖延
You do me an injustice. I was not about to suggest delays.

128
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,875
喔 抱歉      没关系
Oh, sorry. That's all right.

129
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:18,039
我的意见是 如果我们要25%的配额
I suggest that, if we are to have 25% quota,

130
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:24,043
招募规模要比这大得多 最终才能招到25%
Larger intake at the stage so there'll be 25% in the top jobs.

131
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,482
多久?      25年
When? (BOTH) In 25 years.

132
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:30,435
不 汉弗莱 你还没明白我的决心 我要马上
No, Humphrey, you haven't quite got my drift. I mean NOW.

133
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,882
您是说 马上?      真有悟性 汉弗莱
Oh... you mean, NOW? Got it in one, Humphrey.

134
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,316
大臣 马上做事需要时间
It takes time to do things NOW.

135
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:46,280
公务员工作三原则 越拖延越高效
3 articles of Civil Service : takes longer to do things quickly;

136
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:51,202
越费钱越便宜 越秘密越民主
more expensive to do them cheaply, more democratic in secret.

137
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,279
我建议四年完成 时间充足
I have suggested four years. Masses of time.

138
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:57,644
我的天 不行
Oh, dear me, no!

139
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:01,402
不是政治时间 我指现实时间
I don't mean political time, I mean real time.

140
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:07,199
公务员的增长...像大树一样 不是像韭菜
Civil servants are grown like oak trees, not mustard and cress.

141
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:14,164
随季节开花生长 他们的成熟就像...
They bloom and ripen with the seasons, they mature like...

142
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:18,516
像你自己      我刚想说像醇酒
Like yourself. Well, I was about to say like an old port.

143
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,279
要酿上一酿?
Like Grimsby, perhaps.

144
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:27,998
对 我是认真的 大臣      我早料到了
Yes, I was being serious, Minister. I foresaw this problem.

145
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:32,763
我看这好办 外聘女性精英
By bringing in top women from outside the service

146
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,997
来填补高层职缺
to fill vacancies in the top jobs.

147
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,566
我...
I...

148
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,885
我不明白      看我的嘴形 汉弗莱
I don't think I quite understood. Watch my mouth, Humphrey.

149
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,164
我们从编制外招募女性
We will bring in women from outside.

150
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:50,321
但这个体制强大之处就在于它的纯洁及独立
But the strength is that it is unsullied by outside influences.

151
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:53,479
人人都能跳槽 公务员行业有什么特殊?
People move jobs. Why should the Civil Service be different?

152
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,241
它确实特殊 它要求微妙
It IS different. It demands subtlety.

153
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,204
判断力      无私的奉献
Discretion. Devotion to duty.

154
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,677
可靠      可靠 说得好 伯纳
Soundness. Soundness! Well said, Bernard!

155
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:06,477
公务员需要具有超人的毅力和宽广的胸襟
Endless patience and boundless understanding.

156
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:10,037
他们可以迎难而上
They need to be able to change horses mid-stream,

157
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,438
紧密跟随政客 与时俱进
as politicians change what they call their minds.

158
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,680
这些特性你都有了?      我只是恰好...
You have these talents? Well, it is just that one's been properly

159
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:21,697
被人给酿了 就像酒      受过训练
Matured. Like Grimsby. Trained.

160
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:24,884
你扪心自问 要是体制没问题
Ask yourself if there isn't something wrong with the system.

161
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,438
为什么没有女性官员?      她们离职生孩子去了
Why are there so few women? They keep leaving to have babies.

162
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:33,600
50多岁生孩子?不会吧      我不知道 我听您的
At nearly 50? Surely not. I don't know. I'm on your side.

163
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,760
高层确实需要更多女性      好 我不会等25年
We do need more women at the top. I'm not waiting 25 years.

164
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:41,920
副秘书有个空缺吧?      对
There's a vacancy for Deputy Secretary here. Ye-es.

165
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:46,365
我要任命一位女性 莎拉哈里森      莎拉哈里森?
I shall appoint a woman. Sarah Harrison. Sarah Harrison?!

166
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,645
我看她很有能力 你看呢?     是有能力
I think she's very able? Very.

167
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,645
作为女性 作为一个人
For a woman, for a person.

168
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,037
想问题很有创意
And she is an original thinker.

169
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:57,405
恐怕是的 幸好她不带到工作中来
Yes, that's true, but she doesn't let it interfere with her work.

170
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,116
你对她有什么意见?      没有 她很出色
What have you got against her? Nothing. She's excellent.

171
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,084
我很看好她
I'm a supporter of hers.

172
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:07,559
去年就是我最先提出晋升她当副秘书
I advocated her promotion to Under-Secretary at a very early age.

173
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,924
你同意她十分出色吗?      同意
Would you agree that she is outstanding? Yes.

174
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:15,558
那平衡利弊 这是可行的?     平衡利弊 行也不行
So, on balance, it is a good idea? On balance... yes and no.

175
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:20,317
这不是明确答复      这是平衡答复
That's not a very clear answer. It's a balanced answer.

176
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:23,877
问题是她还年轻 还没轮到她
The point is she's too young and it's not her turn.

177
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:29,246
就知道你会说 这就是公务员的问题 论资排辈
This is exactly what's wrong with the Civil Service Buggins' turn!

178
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:34,003
好的人才就要赶快提拔     没错 只要轮到他们
The best people should be promoted As soon as it's their turn!

179
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:38,558
一派胡言 拿破仑30岁就统治欧洲了
Oh, nonsense! Napoleon ruled Europe when he was in his 30s!

180
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:43,243
亚历山大20岁征服世界     他们做不了副秘书
Alexander conquered the world at 20s They made poor Secretaries.

181
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:46,956
他们没有论资排辈      看看他们的下场
They didn't wait their turn! And look what happened to them.

182
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,118
看看我们的问题
And look what's happened to us!

183
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:53,519
治国的不是被年轻有为 有活力的人
Instead of being run by a lot of young, able, energetic men,

184
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:58,681
而是一群疲惫 刻薄的老头 只想安享晚年
this country's being run by 55-year-olds who just want a quiet life!

185
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,840
您在暗示谁吗?
Had you anyone specific in mind?

186
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,277
是又不是 汉弗莱
Yes and no, Humphrey.

187
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:14,523
大臣 莎拉哈里森是位出色的公务员 前途光明
Sarah Harrison is an excellent civil servant, a hope for the future,

188
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:19,807
但她是资历最浅的副秘书 最好不要提拔
but she is our most junior and I will not recommend her promotion.

189
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:24,119
我觉得你性别歧视      大臣 这话怎讲?
I think you're a sexist. Minister, how could you say such a thing?

190
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:27,836
我支持女人 女人很美好
I'm very pro-women. Wonderful people, women.

191
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:32,562
莎拉是位可爱的女士 我对她景仰之至
Sarah is a dear lady. I'm one of her greatest admirers.

192
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:38,836
但如果要推进女权 必须小心谨慎
the cause of women must be done with care, tact and discretion.

193
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:45,003
女性高官就她一个人选 不能急功近利
She is our only woman for a top job. We mustn't push her too fast.

194
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:49,046
高层职务对女性太难了     听听你这什么话
Women find top jobs very difficult. Can you hear yourself?

195
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:55,203
如果她们能胜任 就不会这么少 顺理成章的
If they could be good Permanent Secretaries there would be more.

196
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,598
不 汉弗莱...      我不反女权 我爱女人
No... I'm not anti-feminist! I love women!

197
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,964
我有很要好的女性朋友
Some of my best friends are women!

198
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,004
比如我妻子就是女的
Er... my wife, indeed.

199
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:12,401
但莎拉经验不足 而且孩子还在上学
But Sarah is inexperienced and her children are still of school age.

200
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,400
他们可能会得腮腺炎      你还得神经炎呢
They might get mumps! You might get shingles!

201
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:21,119
您再说我马上就要得了 万一她为孩子旷工呢?
Indeed if you continue. What if children caused her to miss work?

202
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:26,077
那她还能当上副秘书? 她是人中精英
Would she have reached Under-Secretary? She is the best person!

203
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,444
大臣 如果您提拔她只因为她是精英
If you promote women just because they're the best person,

204
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,520
您会造成公务员里怨言四起
you will create a lot of resentment throughout the Civil Service!

205
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:37,680
至少女性不会有怨言     可以忽略 不是吗?
Not from the women in it. Well, that hardly matters, does it?

206
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,565
可以忽略 汉弗莱?
Hardly matters?

207
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,567
她们人太少了
There are so few of them.

208
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,282
我试图说服他女性和我们不一样 他没法明白
I've told him women are different, but he can't grasp it.

209
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:54,836
她们太拖团队的后腿
They put such strains on a team.

210
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:59,046
她们对事态度不同 她们太感性 不如我们理性
They react differently. They're so emotional. Not rational like us.

211
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:04,884
还不能明说 不然她们要么嚼舌头要么掉眼泪
Hopeless when tell them off. Either into a bate or blubbing.

212
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:09,279
不掉眼泪的就撒泼
If not the sort who blub, they become frightfully hard and butch.

213
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,438
一点都不迷人
Not the least bit attractive.

214
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:15,804
她们偏见很多      总是武断的以偏概全
They're full of prejudices. Make silly generalisations.

215
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:21,125
想事都一个路数      嗯...
They think in stereotypes. (BOTH) Mmm.

216
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,006
阿诺德 你觉得我应该怎么办?
Arnold, what do you think I should do?

217
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:28,160
我只能建议不停给他灌输 直到他烦了
Lecture him at such length on the matter that he becomes bored

218
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,363
觉得这个想法无趣了
and loses interest in the idea.

219
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:34,520
对 也许有用 不过他可不容易烦
Yes, might work. Mind you, he doesn't get bored easily.

220
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,884
他甚至都不烦他自己      总会烦的
He even finds himself interesting. They all do.

221
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:42,837
只要是听他们说话的人      听的人可不多
All the ones who listen to what we're saying. Not many of those.

222
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:47,000
标准2号方案 是说工会不接受
The standard second ploy is to tell him the unions won't wear it.

223
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,886
工会会接受的      那不重要 汉弗莱
They'd like it. That's beside the point.

224
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:54,563
喔 抱歉      他妻子会怎么想呢?
Oh, yes, sorry. What does his wife think about all this?

225
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:59,323
听说他妻子挺支持的 也许她是幕后推手
I gather she's in favour of itn. In fact, she may be behind it.

226
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,925
我明白了 她知不知道哈里森很迷人呢?
I see. Does she know that Sarah Harrison is rather attractive?

227
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,916
不 她们好像没见过...
No, I don't think they've ever met...

228
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,478
好主意
Good idea.

229
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,957
必须发动内阁来反对这个鬼定额
We must mobilise the Cabinet against this quota nonsense.

230
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:21,325
内阁会欢迎的      我们让他们改主意
They'll be in favour of it. We can get them to change their minds.

231
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:25,719
他们很容易改主意      就象女人一样
They change their minds fairly easily. Just like a lot of women!

232
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,037
幸好内阁不掉眼泪
Thank God they don't blub!

233
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:34,401
大臣 我觉得您说的是对的
Minister, I have come to the conclusion that you were right.

234
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,761
你说真的 汉弗莱?      没错 大臣
Are you being serious? Yes, indeed.

235
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:45,957
您的计划已提上日程 我现在积极反对性别歧视
I am now positively against discrimination against women

236
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:50,917
同时积极支持性别优待 当然是有差别的优待
In favour of positive discrimination discriminating discrimination

237
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,398
对...我好像明白了
Yes... I think I've got that.

238
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:58,321
据说最高层的看法是 这个问题要解决
The view is, at the very highest level, that this should happen.

239
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,955
很好      不过...
Good. However...

240
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:06,961
定额有些问题 介意我坐下吗? 工会无法接受
Problem about the quota. The unions won't wear it.

241
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:11,600
真的? 叫他们来 我来谈      不行 大臣
Really? Let's have 'em in. We'll talk about it. Er... no, Minister.

242
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:15,726
那就捅了马蜂窝了      为什么?
That would... just stir up a hornets' nest. Why?

243
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:22,438
恕我直言 我们得现实点
Well, if I might suggest... that we be realistic about this.

244
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:27,158
现实点 你意思是全盘放弃      天啊 不是
By realistic, you mean drop the whole scheme. Oh, dear me, no!

245
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:30,046
也许应当暂缓 重新整顿
But, perhaps, a pause to re-group.

246
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:34,644
慢慢评估现状 商讨其它战略
Reassess the situation and discuss alternative strategies.

247
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:37,560
慢慢深思熟虑
A space of time for reflection and deliberation.

248
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:41,161
你就是说全盘放弃
You mean drop the whole scheme.

249
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,922
不 汉弗莱 我决心已定 马上着手
No, I've set my hand to the plough, I've made the decision.

250
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:49,080
4年内实现25%女性公务员
We shall have a 25% quota of women within the next four years

251
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,239
就从任命莎拉哈里森为副秘书开始
and, to make a start, I shall appoint Sarah Harrison.

252
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:56,605
我向您保证 这是犯错误     原则 汉弗莱 原则
That is the wrong decision. Principle, Humphrey, principle.

253
00:17:56,767 --> 00:18:01,716
内阁同僚都说支持我 女权赢得很多选票
I'm sure Cabinet will support me. A lot of votes in women's rights.

254
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:05,675
选票 大臣? 您不是说为原则吗
Votes? I thought you said it was a matter of principle.

255
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:11,201
对我是原则 汉弗莱 对他们是选票
For ME. I was talking about them.

256
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,244
喂
Yes?

257
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,398
哈克太太来了 大臣      请她进来好吗
Mrs Hacker's here. Send her in.

258
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,958
请她进来 您能不能先把信件签了 大臣?
Could you sign the letters before you go, Minister?

259
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:23,358
亲爱的 让汉弗莱给你点喝的     雪利酒?
Hello. Get Humphrey to give you a drink. Sherry?

260
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,964
还记得您批"转圜否决"那个文件吗?
Remember that letter you wrote "round objects" on?

261
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,721
汉弗莱爵士回复并批注了
Sir Humphrey has commented on it.

262
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:35,278
说什么?     "转圜是谁 他否决什么"?
What's he say? "Who is Round and to what does he object?"

263
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,966
拿着 你气色不错
Here you are. Your very good health.

264
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:44,722
改革公务员系统要慢工出细活的
Yes, it's a slow business changing the Civil Service.

265
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,879
吉姆说要提拔的那个女性呢?
What about promoting this woman Jim was talking about?

266
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:53,644
对 您丈夫确实慧眼识珠 莎拉很有才华
Your husband certainly has an eye for talent, Sarah's very talented.

267
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,799
美丽又迷人 干杯      真的?
Quite delightful, real charmer. Cheers. Really?

268
00:18:56,967 --> 00:19:01,119
我真佩服新一代的女性公务员
I very much admire this new generation of women civil servants

269
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:04,085
和从前那些老顽固相比
compared to the old battle-axes I remember!

270
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:11,642
当然 她们不见得有莎拉好看 不过都很有女人味
Not all as beautiful as Sarah but they keep their femininity.

271
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:17,279
吉姆从没说过她长什么样     大概他没注意
Jim never discussed what she looks like. Perhaps he hasn't noticed.

272
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,043
真难以相信 他们两个总泡在一起
I find that hard to believe. He does spend a lot of time with her.

273
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,643
如果她晋升还会更...坐下好吗?
And even more... if she's promoted. Shall we sit down?

274
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:33,724
先生们 我们大臣决定创造25%的女性定额
Gentlemen, my minister is set on creating a quota of 25% women,

275
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:36,082
最终达到50%
leading to an eventual 50%.

276
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:39,000
公平 我明白了      对 嗯
Parity, I see. Yes. Mm.

277
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:44,195
在我看来男女确实应该平等对待
It seems right to me that women be treated fairly and equally.

278
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:47,916
大家要达成共识 原则上
I speak for all of us when I say that, in principle,

279
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,965
应该规定定额 达到这个目标     对对
there should be such targets set and goals achieved.

280
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:57,205
比尔?      我十分赞同这个想法
Bill? Well, I'm fully in favour of this idea.

281
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,962
我们必须对女性特别优待
We must have positive discrimination in favour of women.

282
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:03,721
但在外交部行不通
It wouldn't work with the Foreign Office.

283
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,675
不能派女性大使到伊朗那样的穆斯林国家
We couldn't post women ambassadors to Iran or Muslim nations.

284
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:13,046
没错 没错      第三世界比我们落后
No, quite, quite. The Third World is not so advanced as us.

285
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:17,803
外交官每三年都要换届
We have to send diplomats to new postings every three years,

286
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:22,040
我们部行不通 但我从原则上支持
this idea is obviously not for us, but I do approve the principle.

287
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,158
尼尔?      我十分赞同
Neil? I'm in favour of it.

288
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:28,716
增加些女性有好处
I think we need the feminine touch.

289
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:33,278
女性处理某些事有独到之处 毫无疑问
Women are better at handling some problems than men.

290
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:37,235
但内务部是个例外
We would have to make an exception in the Home Office.

291
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,195
女人不适合看监狱 做警察
Women are not the right people to run prisons or the police.

292
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,404
很有可能她们自己也不想做
Quite probably, they wouldn't want to do it, anyway.

293
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,765
但你从原则上赞成?      当然 毫无疑问的
But you do agree with the principle? Oh, yes, without question.

294
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:52,886
皮特?      唉 国防部也一样
Peter? Yes, the same applies to Defence... alas.

295
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,038
管的全是陆海军大将
All those admirals and generals.

296
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:59,598
女人做不了安全部的头目
It wouldn't be possible to appoint a woman as Head of Security.

297
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,327
男的得变成女的
M would have to become F.

298
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,238
国防部是男人的天下 工业和就业部也一样
Yes, Defence is clearly a man's world, like Industry and Employment.

299
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,126
那些工会领袖
All those trade union leaders!

300
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,482
卫生和社会事务部呢 约翰?
But what about the DHSS? John?

301
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,845
很高兴地说 卫生部高层女性够多了
Woman are well represented near the top of the DHSS.

302
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:23,125
毕竟 白厅里4个女副秘书我们占2个
After all, we have two of the four Deputy Secretaries in Whitehall.

303
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:29,117
她们不够格做常务秘书 都是副总医务官
Not eligible for Permanent Secretary. Deputy Chief Medical Officers.

304
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:33,439
我不觉得他们适合 那不公平
I'm not sure they're really suitable. No, that's unfair.

305
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:38,601
当然了 80%书记员 99%打字员都是女性
Women are 80% of our clerical staff and 99% of the typing grades.

306
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:43,841
我们成绩不错 原则上说 我支持她们进入高层
We're not doing too badly. In principle, I'm in favour of it.

307
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,406
很好 很好
Good, good.

308
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:49,799
会议结论是 从原则出发 我们都赞成
The feeling of the meeting is, in principle we're all in favour

309
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,162
女士们的平等权益
of equal rights for the ladies,

310
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:55,922
但特定部门里有特殊境况
but there are special problems in individual departments.

311
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:59,796
是 是      那定额问题怎么办?
(ALL) Hear hear! What about this question of the quota?

312
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:03,482
老实说 我不太同意      对 不赞成
Frankly, I'm against it. (ALL) Oh, yes, not on!

313
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:08,641
我们得有权提拔最有能力的人才
We must have the right to promote the best man for the job,

314
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,367
无论性别
regardless of sex.

315
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,321
我作为一个热忱的女权主义者
Speaking as an ardent feminist myself,

316
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:19,685
觉得问题在于招收哪种女性
I think the problem lies in recruiting the right sort of women.

317
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,236
已婚有家室的就不行
Married women with families drop out

318
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,400
她们不能全身心投入到工作中去
because they cannot give their work their full attention.

319
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,558
未婚无子女的
Unmarried women with no children

320
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:33,243
不够成熟 涉世未深
are not fully-rounded people with a thorough understanding of life.

321
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:38,638
实践中不可能找到成熟的
It's rarely possible to find a fully-rounded married woman,

322
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:45,076
已婚育有三个孩子 全心全意工作的女性
with a home and 3 children, devote her whole life to a department.

323
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:50,480
就是22条军规第一项 精神不健全可以免出勤
It's Catch 22, really. Well, Catch 22, sub-paragraph A!

324
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:57,400
我觉得要让内阁大臣们否决这个提案
We must ensure that our ministers oppose this quota idea

325
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:02,561
就要各自讲清各部特殊情况
by drawing their attention to each department's special problems.

326
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:07,198
但各级部门都要从原则上赞同
But we will recommend the principle of equal at every level.

327
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:11,757
我再说一句好吗?
May I suggest one more thing?

328
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:17,923
我们大臣还把提拔女性看作是
My minister sees the promotion as creating greater diversity

329
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:20,078
在公务员高层实现多元化
at the top of the service.

330
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:26,516
要使他们明白 说真的 我们已经很多元化了
Stress to our ministers that there's no more diverse lot than us.

331
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:31,761
绝对的      跨越行业的典范
(ALL) Absolutely! A real cross-section of the nation.

332
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:39,481
大臣 内阁会议怎样?
Ah, Minister, how was Cabinet?

333
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:43,995
很怪 真的      为什么?
Bit odd, actually. Why?

334
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,557
我们讨论了女性高层定额的事
We were talking about the top jobs quota for women.

335
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,446
同意了吗?      怪就怪在这
Was it agreed? That's what's so odd.

336
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:56,204
原则上都支持 但在他们自己部里行不通
Agreed in principle, but said it wouldn't work in their departments.

337
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,200
他们一点都不支持我      太怪了
They didn't support me at all. Extraordinary.

338
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:02,200
还有 安妮也不支持我了
And I'm not getting support from Annie.

339
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:06,280
真的? 定额的事?      提拔莎拉的事
Really? What, about this quota? Well, about promoting Sarah.

340
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,245
还以为她绝对支持呢      就是
You'd think she'd be 100% behind it. Indeed.

341
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,524
我一说她态度完全反了
She goes sort of distant when I mention it.

342
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:16,157
打死也不愿意      更怪了
Dead against it now. Even more extraordinary.

343
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,921
反正就这一件事了
Oh, well, seems the only thing left.

344
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,920
我力所能及的      对 没错
Something I can achieve. Yes, indeed.

345
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:26,683
请哈里森女士进来好吗? 伯纳 请去叫一下
Shall I ask Mrs Harrison to come in? Would you be kind enough?

346
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:30,757
至少是我值得一提的成就 汉弗莱
At least this is something I can say I have done.

347
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,758
没错 大臣      星星之火
Indeed. Lighting a spark.

348
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:35,122
可以燎原
Carrying a torch, even.

349
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,996
莎拉 请坐
Ah, Sarah, do sit down.

350
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,158
谢谢     汉弗莱     谢谢 大臣
Thank you. Humphrey.

351
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:48,241
莎拉 也许你听说了 副秘书有一个空缺
There is a vacancy for a Deputy Secretary in this department.

352
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,399
虽然你是资历最浅的秘书
In spite of you being the most junior Under-Secretary,

353
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:54,161
但因为你能力出众
but because you are the outstanding person,

354
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:59,526
汉弗莱爵士和我推荐你晋升为副秘书
Sir Humphrey and I have recommend you to Deputy Secretary.

355
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,477
我...我不知说什么好
I... I don't know what to say.

356
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:08,959
什么都不用说      一个谢谢就够了
No need to say anything. A single thank you should suffice.

357
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:13,399
不...嗯...我是说...
No... Well... I mean...

358
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:17,560
太难启齿了 我是说
Oh, gosh. Look, this is awfully embarrassing. I mean...

359
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:22,755
本来想这周告诉你们的 我要辞职了
I was going to tell you. I'm resigning from the Civil Service.

360
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,838
什么?      辞职?
What? Resigning?

361
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:29,718
对 所以...谢谢好意 我心领了
Yes, so... thank you, but no, thank you.

362
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:35,678
要照顾孩子?      腮腺炎?
Some problem at home with your children? Mumps?

363
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,484
不 我要进一家商业银行 做主管
No, I'm joining a merchant bank... as a director.

364
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:45,725
莎拉...我明说了吧 这里面另有文章
Sarah... I won't conceal from you the fact that this is a blow.

365
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:49,004
我和汉弗莱之所以举荐你
The reason Humphrey and I decided to recommend you

366
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:54,560
是因为增加女性定额的努力快失败了
I've been fighting a losing battle to improve promotion for women.

367
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,958
可以说是借用你来...当跳板
You were to be my, so to speak, Trojan horse.

368
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:04,118
老实说 大臣 我想干的工作不是没完没了
Quite honestly, I want a job where I don't spend endless hours

369
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:09,884
给无关人等就无关事项传递无关信息
Information about subjects don't matter to people aren't interested.

370
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:17,684
我想有所成就 不想整天忙那些文山会海
I want a job where there's achievement rather than merely activity.

371
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:21,362
我想指着什么东西自豪的说 "我做的"
I want to point to something and say "I did that."

372
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,121
我不明白
I don't understand.

373
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:27,078
我知道 所以我才要走
I know. That's why I'm leaving.

374
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,116
你觉得治理国家不重要?
You're not saying the government is unimportant?

375
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:35,565
当然重要 不过我没看到谁在治理国家
It's just that I haven't met anyone who's doing it.

376
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,284
再说 这些花招我也厌烦了
Also I've had enough of the pointless intrigue.

377
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:45,644
花招?      您明白的
Intrigue? You know the sort of thing.

378
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:50,801
比如女权这件事 您得靠我当跳板
Like this women's rights. Your using me as a Trojan horse.

379
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:54,960
他们大概跟您说工会反对提拔我
They probably said the unions wouldn't wear it if you promoted me.

380
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:59,757
你怎么知道的?      我不知道 这是惯用伎俩
How did you know that? I didn't. I just know how things are done.

381
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,079
你不知道我为你付出了多大努力
You don't realise I've fought quite a battle for you.

382
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,286
是吗? 我没要求您为我争取什么
Oh, have you? I didn't ask you to fight a battle for me.

383
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:11,519
我不想被当成25%定额
I'm not pleased at being part of a 25% quota.

384
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:16,203
女人不是低等人 我也不喜欢被施舍
Women are not inferior beings and I don't enjoy being patronised.

385
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:22,003
恐怕您和他们一样家长式 沙文主义
You're just as paternalist and chauvinist as the rest of them.

386
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:28,083
我要去一个平等的 把我当人看的地方
I'm going somewhere to be accepted an equal, as a person.

387
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,477
没出路的 是吗?
You can't win, can you?

388
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:34,877
我可以走了吗?      嗯? 当然
May I go now? Hm? Yes, of course.

389
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:40,996
很抱歉伤害了你的感情 虽然我没明白怎么回事
I'm sorry I offended you, though I can't remember how I did.

390
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,566
是没有
No.

391
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:46,959
谢谢 我知道你们出于好意
And thank you. I know you both mean well.

392
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,245
女人啊
Women!

393
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:01,125
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
