("丘吉尔在野生涯")

6
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,802
他什么时候来?
What time is he coming?

7
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,884
随时会来 早该到了
Any time. Should be here now.

8
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:01,053
也许他出事了
Perhaps something’s happened to him.

9
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,011
你说他误了公交车?
You think he's missed his bus?

10
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,684
不不不
No, no, no.

11
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:09,562
我是说他可能遇到些...事
I mean something may have... happened.

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,769
他到底是什么人?
Who is he, exactly?

13
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:18,004
我只知道他是陆军军官 有事告诉我
All I know is he's an army officer with something to tell me

14
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,924
电话里不便明说
he wouldn't divulge on the phone.

15
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,322
估计没多大事      可能吧
it’s probably nothing. Perhaps.

16
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,926
记得"丘吉尔在野生涯"里说的吗?
Remember Churchill, the wilderness years?

17
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,883
他得知陆军无法抵御希特勒的事
He found out about our military inadequacy

18
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:30,451
就是听军官说的
from army officers.

19
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:35,003
所以他在野期间 还能朝媒体漏消息
So in the wilderness he could leak stories to the press

20
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:38,164
让政府难堪 我也能
and embarrass the government. I could do that!

21
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:41,768
可你在政府里啊
But you're in the government.

22
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,771
哦 对
Oh, yes!

23
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,010

Sit down. Thanks.

31
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:24,361
不必多礼      谢谢 我是说 抱歉
No need to keep thanking me. Thanks. I mean, sorry.

32
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:28,207
也不必抱歉      抱歉 我是说 谢谢
No need to apologise, either. Sorry. I mean, thanks.

33
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:32,843
你们谈话要我回避吗?      请留下 你不介意的话
Shall I let you talk in private? Stay if that's Ok with you.

34
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:36,322
对 不用瞒安妮 我什么都告诉她
Yes. No secrets from Annie. I tell her everything.

35
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,164
一般反复说几遍
Several times, usually!

36
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:44,090
那么这是高度机密?      对 确实是
So, is this highly confidential? It is, rather, yes.

37
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:47,642
要开收音机吗?      有什么好节目吗?
Shall I turn on the radio? Is there something good on?

38
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:53,765
以防我们被窃听      有这可能吗?
In case we're being bugged. Oh. is that likely?

39
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:57,322
谁负责窃听政客?
Who's in charge Of bugging politicians?

40
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,006
对 想起来了 是我
Yes, come to think of it, I am!

41
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,049
那就没事了
That's all right, then.

42
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,120
我能不能说 我告诉您的事
Could I say that what I'm about to tell you

43
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,522
是以私人身份说的?
I'm telling you on a personal basis?

44
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,490
好吧 具体什么意思?
Fine... What do you mean, exactly?

45
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:12,926
我是私下告诉您
I'm telling you personally

46
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,481
不是告诉行政事务大臣
and not as Minister for Administrative Affairs.

47
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:17,802
可我就是行政事务大臣
But I am Minister of Administrative Affairs.

48
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,281
但我告诉的不是那个您
But I'm not telling you in that role.

49
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,488
而是新闻工作者
I'm telling you as a journalist.

50
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,769
新闻工作者? 你不是陆军军官嘛
Journalist? I thought you were an army officer?

51
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:29,925
不 您作为新闻工作者      我是大臣
No, you're a journalist. I'm a minister.

52
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:34,047
对 可你当大臣之前呢?
But what were you before you became a minister?

53
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:37,090
你出道的本钱 不是赏你的
Your starter for ten, no conferring!

54
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,765
对 我明白了
I get your drift.

55
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,002
你是说你跟我说的
You're telling me what you're telling me,

56
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:43,561
尽管我不知道你要说什么
though I don't know yet what you're telling me,

57
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:46,087
是说给"改革"杂志的前主编 是吗?
as the former editor of “Reform".

58
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,527
对 您是个好主编
Yes. You were a very fine editor.

59
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,411
我不能这么说      你经常这么说
I wouldn't say that. You've often said that!

60
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,846
可怎么防止作为大臣的我
But how do I prevent myself, as a minister,

61
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:58,209
得知你告诉作为主编的我的消息呢?
from knowing what you'll tell me as a former editor?

62
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,932
我没法不让大臣知道
I can't prevent the minister from knowing.

63
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:03,845
我想他是说 这是头衔问题      好吧
He means it’s a question of hats. Yes.

64
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,651
我今晚不顶大臣头衔
I'm not wearing my ministerial hat tonight,

65
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,291
但我得警告你
but I ought to warn you,

66
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:10,602
如果我有必要知道这件事
If I need to be told what you tell me,

67
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,889
我会义无反顾地告诉我自己
I shan't hesitate in my duty to keep myself informed!

68
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,044
好吧 谁负责
Fine. Now, who's in charge

69
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:21,965
英国军火出口?
of selling British weapons to foreigners?

70
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,726
抢答 哈克 伦敦政经学院      闭嘴
Bzzz. Hacker, LSE. Shut up, Annie.

71
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:30,645
您曾经在"改革"上撰文
You wrote an article in "Reform" about the sale

72
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,565
抨击英国政府乱卖军火
of British weapons to undesirable foreigners.

73
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,371
对 那篇文章叫 "可怕的交易"
Yes, it was called "The Dreadful Trade".

74
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,923
为我们自己和盟友生产军火纯属爱国之举
Patriotic to manufacture arms for our own defence.

75
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,925
尽管有些盟友不大可爱
Although not all our allies are very commendable.

76
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,128
但我们绝不能把军火
But we must not sell weapons

77
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:50,808
卖给暴政国家 纳粹独裁者
to bolster the regimes of foreign despots, Nazi dictators...

78
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,850
或者恐怖分子      对 恐怖分子...恐怖分子?

NATO, wasn't it? A military delegation to NATO.

81
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,091
在那里 他们给我看了一些
While I was there, they showed me something

82
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:08,971
恐怖分子总部缴获的东西
they'd captured in a raid on a terrorist HQ.

83
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,600
一台电子炸弹引爆器
It was a computerised bomb detonator.

84
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,411
非常新 非常秘密 非常致命
Very new, very secret, and very lethal.

85
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:19,123
谁给你看的?      恐怕我不能说 这是机密
Who showed it to you? I can't possibly say. it’s a confidence.

86
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:22,125
好吧 电子炸弹引爆器?
I see. Computerised bomb detonator?

87
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,965
对 可以设置来测量目标体重
You set it to calculate the weight of the victim,

88
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,566
车速 确保弹无虚发
speed of his car, so you're sure to get him,

89
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:32,442
设好之后 用雷达还可以遥控
and you can reprogram it remotely, by radio, after setting it.

90
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:36,810
天 真没想到意大利人也懂这种高科技
Gosh. I don't associate Italians with that sort of technology!

91
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:43,331
不是意大利产的 是这里产的
It wasn’t made in Italy. It was made here.

92
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,686
英国制造?
Made in Britain?

93
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:49,323
对 国防部下的订单 英国纳税人的出钱
Defence contract and paid for by the British taxpayer.

94
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,245
意大利恐怖分子在用?      正是
And used by Italian terrorists? Yes.

95
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:55,290
他们哪来的?      我就是问这个
Where did they get them? That's what I want to know.

96
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,886
没跟别人说过吧?
You haven't told anybody else?

97
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:01,647
我不能 如果我正式上报 就得透露消息来源
If I make an official report, I have to disclose my sources.

98
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,804
可如果我告诉接近政府高层的人...
But if I tell someone near the top of government...

99
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,566
呃 其实就是政府高层
Er, at the top, actually.

100
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:14,050
对 告诉他英国秘密武器给了意大利恐怖分子
British equipment was being supplied to Italian terrorists,

101
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:16,806
他就会...      当然
then he would, er... Absolutely.

102
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:19,131
他会怎样?
What would he?

103
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,445
查出怎么回事
Find out how it’s being done.

104
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:25,127
调查必须由英国政府高层发起
The investigation would have to start in Britain at the top level.

105
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:26,807
好
Fine.

106
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:31,127
可你说你是私下告诉我
But you told me you were telling me on a personal level.

107
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,489
对 可您私下知道了 就算没正式知道
Yes, but now you know personally, if not officially,

108
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,927
您也可以用私人消息
you can use your personal knowledge

109
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,844
展开正式调查
to start official investigations

110
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,890
以正式查证来打消私人疑虑
to get official confirmation of personal suspicions

111
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:45,362
所以您私下 而不是正式知道的
so what you now know personally, but not officially,

112
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:48,000
届时就能正式知道 也私下知道了
you will then know officially as well as personally.

113
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:52,283
你该不会是汉弗莱爵士家亲戚吧?
You're not related to Sir Humphrey Appleby by any chance?

114
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:55,722
谁?      算了
Who? Never mind!

115
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,050
我就是觉得有必要告诉谁      当然
I felt I had to tell someone. Absolutely.

116
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,761
好 现在我知道了 私下的
Well, now I know, personally.

太妙了 您会采取些措施吧?
Marvellous. Gong to do something about it, aren't you?

当然 绝对要采取      马上?

马上
Right away.

120
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:16,121
您要采取什么措施?
What are you gong to do?

121
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,650
我会好好考虑你的消息 马上
I'm gong to think about what you've told me. Right away.

122
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:24,806
然后呢?
And then?

123
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:29,682
然后会考虑许多对策
Then I will consider various courses of action.

124
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:33,003
毫不含糊      您要毫不含糊地采取对策
Without delay. You'll take action without delay.

125
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,527
我要毫不含糊地开始考虑对策
I will consider taking action without delay.

126
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,445
你不是汉弗莱爵士家亲戚吧?
Are you related to Sir Humphrey Appleby?

127
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:42,207
再来一杯?      不了 我得走了
Like another drink? No, I must be off.

128
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:45,409
能信得过您来处理这件可怕的事吧
Can I rely on you to tackle this shocking matter?

129
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,130
尽管放心
Indeed you can.

130
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:49,968
再见      晚安
Goodbye. Goodnight.

131
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,649
晚安 少校 谢谢      晚安 先生
Goodnight, Major. Goodnight, sir.

132
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:04,163
你怎么看?      你会采取措施吧?
What do you think? You'll do something?

133
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:06,607
我当然会 如果应该的话
I certainly will, if it’s right.

134
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,531
但我不能相信这会是真的
But I can't believe it’s true.

135
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,842
可能是真的吗?
Could it happen?

136
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,687
不可能吧 可能吗?
Couldn't. Could it?

137
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,331
不光不应该 而且不可能
It's not just that it shouldn't. It couldn't.

138
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,767
就算可能 也不应该 应该是吧
And if it could, it wouldn’t. Would it?

139
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,049
你还真是汉弗莱爵士家亲戚
You are related to Sir Humphrey Appleby!

140
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:29,802
汉弗莱 有件事我必须跟你谈
Humphrey, I must talk to you about something

141
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,849
这事我非常忧心
which concerns me deeply.

142
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,321
确实事关重大
Really profoundly important.

143

in government establishments?

145
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:42,530
那是开发区地方政府租约
The procedure for renewal of local authority leaseholds

146
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,091
延期程序?
in development areas?

147
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:49,167
不 我担心的是关系到人命的大问题
No, what concerns me is a great issue really of life and death.

148
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:51,892
哦 这个不该工作时间谈吧?
Shouldn't that wait till after work?

149
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:57,041
这就是工作      真的? 那请说
It is work. Really? Please go on.

150
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:59,601
英国军工企业是怎样
How do British armaments manufacturers

151
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,649
向外国出口武器的?
sell their arms to foreigners?

152
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:05,407
我想是先从经贸部申领出口许可证
You get an export licence from the Department of Trade.

153
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,040
私营企业也能出口军火?
Private firms can sell their arms abroad?

154
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:11,363
通过行业和政府中介      卖给谁?
Companies and government agencies. To whom?

155
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:14,046
一般是外国政府      没别人?
Foreign governments, usually. Is that all?

156
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:17,488
有时候也卖给军火商 二道贩子
Well, sometimes you can sell to an arms dealer, third party.

157
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:21,884
一个曼城人可能代表海峡群岛某个集团
A man in Manchester buys on behalf of Channel Islands

158
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:23,849
合同订立于卢森堡...
with contacts in Luxembourg...

159
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:27,209
没法真正控制终端用户是谁吗?
There's no real control over who the arms go to in the end?

160
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:31,763
有的 军火商必须出具终端用户证书
Indeed there is. The dealer has to provide an end user certificate

161
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:35,083
得有政府承认的签字
which is a signature acceptable to the government

162
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,164
证明最终顾客有使用授权
that the ultimate customer Is an approved user.

163
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:39,970
真的有保障吗?
Is that a real guarantee?

164
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:42,885
你能不能料到一艘英国航母
Would you be surprised if a British aircraft carrier

165
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,361
在中非共和国出现?
turned up in the Central African Republic?

166
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,522
大臣 这我还真料不到
I, for one, would be very surprised.

167
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,364
那里距海一千英里呢
It's 1,000 miles inland!

168
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:57,842
你懂我的意思 小型武器呢?
You know what I mean. What about smaller weapons?

169
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,526
官方绝对禁止的 有严格安全措施
It's officially impossible. Stringent security,

170
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,331
严密的检查手续 还有仔细的复查
rigorous inspections, meticulous scrutiny.

171
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,642
那就是烟幕弹啰?
You mean it’s all a facade?

172
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,361
这个讨论到此为止吧 大臣?
I think this conversation should end here.

173
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,807
不行 正如我所料
No, it’s as I thought.

174
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:19,691
昨晚 一个机密线人向我透露
A confidential source has disclosed to me

175
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,561
英国军火被卖给了意大利恐怖分子
that British arms are being sold to Italian terrorists.

176
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:27,686
这样啊 请问哪位机密线人?
I see. May I ask who this confidential source was?

177
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,412
汉弗莱 我说了是机密
Humphrey, I said it was confidential.

178
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:34,565
抱歉 我习惯性地以为您这是要告诉我
Sorry. I naturally assumed that meant you were gong to tell me.

179
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,605
你好像一点不担心
You don't seem worried.

180
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,650
这种事随时都有 不归我们管
It happens all the time. It's not our problem.

181
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:43,043
暴力抢劫也不归我们 你也不在乎?
So does robbery with violence. Doesn't that worry you?

182
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,407
不 大臣 内政部的事
No, Minister. Home Office problem.

183
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:50,325
汉弗莱 我们把致命武器给了恐怖分子
Humphrey, we're letting terrorists have murderous weapons!

184
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,881
我们没有      那谁给的?
We're not. Well, who is?

185
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,806
天晓得 经贸部 国防部 外交部?
Trade? Ministry of Defence? Foreign Office?

186
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,611
是我们 汉弗莱 英国政府
We, Humphrey, the British government.

187
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:04,050
无辜的生命正受恐怖分子的英国武器威胁
Innocent lives set at risk by British arms in the hands of terrorists.

188
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,564
意大利人的命 不是英国的 大臣
Only Italian lives, not British lives, Minister.

189
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:12,331
也有英国游客      游客 外交部的事
Could be British tourists abroad. Tourists? Foreign Office problem.

190
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,367
汉弗莱 我们得采取行动
Humphrey, we have to do something.

191
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,540
恕我直言 大臣 我们得按兵不动
With respect, we have to do nothing.

192
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,765
怎么讲?      对外军售
What do you mean? The sale of arms abroad

193
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:23,208
是政府中不该细究的问题
Is one area of government we do not examine too closely.

194
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,806
不行 我都知道了      说您不知道
I have to, now I know. Say you don't know.

195
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,884
你说我不能捅?      大臣 不是说您
Are you suggesting I lie? Not you, Minister, no.

196
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,203
那谁不能捅?      马蜂窝不能捅 大臣
Well, who should lie? Sleeping dogs, Minister.

197
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,486
我得提出来      不行 大臣 我求您
I'm gong to raise this. No, I beg you.

198
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:40,531
政府原则之一就是没必要管的事不要管
A rule of government is never look into anything you don't have to,

199
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:44,162
若不能预知结果 不要展开调查
never start an enquiry unless you know what its findings will be.

200
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:47,483
真不敢相信 这是正义与邪恶问题
I can't believe this! We're talking about good and evil.

201
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:50,530
圣公会的事      不 汉弗莱
Church of England problem. No, Humphrey!

202
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,651
我们的事 关系到大是大非
Our problem. We are discussing right and wrong.

203
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,327
您也许是 跟我无关 这是浪费公务时间
I'm not. It's misuse of government time.

204
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,713
卖军火给恐怖分子不对 你不懂吗 汉弗莱?
Selling arms to terrorists is wrong.

205
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,598
不 大臣 军火要么卖要么不卖
Either you sell arms or you don't.

206
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,885
卖的话 总会落到出钱的人手里
If you sell them, they end up with people who can afford them.

207
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:11,486
恐怖分子不行吧?
But not terrorists?

208
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:13,210
我想我们可以
I suppose we could put

209
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:16,284
在枪托上贴政府健康警示
a government health warning on the rifle butts!

210
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:19,964
"枪支严重损害健康"
"This gun can seriously damage your health."

211
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:23,044
你可能不在乎 汉弗莱 可我们不能忽视
You may take this lightly, but we cannot close our eyes

212
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,328
这种重大道德错误
to something as morally wrong as this.

213
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,086
好吧 大臣 如果您非要谈道德问题
If you insist on discussing moral issues,

214
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,812
请容我指出 道德只有对与错
something is either morally wrong or it isn’t.

215
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,928
没有小错和大错
It can't be slightly morally wrong.

216
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:36,846
别绕弯子 汉弗莱      政府不追求道德
Don't quibble. Government isn’t about morality.

217
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,608
是吗 那追求什么?      稳定 社会正常运转
Really? What is it about? Stability. Keeping things gong.

218
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:46,050
预防混乱 制止分裂 屹立不倒
Stopping society falling to bits. Still being here tomorrow.

219
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,521
为了什么?      您说什么?
What for? I beg your pardon?

220
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:52,128
如果政府不行善 那它的目的是什么?
What is the purpose of government if not for doling good?

221
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:56,444
大臣 政府不关乎善与恶 只关乎治与乱
Government isn’t about good and evil. It's about order or chaos.

222
00:12:56,612 --> 00:13:01,128
意大利恐怖分子用英国炸弹还不乱?
It's in order for Italian terrorists to get British bombs?

223
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,931
你不在乎?      职责不要求我在乎
You don't care? it’s not my job to care.

224
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:08,005
那是政客的事 我是执行政策的
That's what politicians are for. My job is to carry out policy.

225
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:12,802
就算你认为政策不对?      政府政策几乎都不对
If you think it’s wrong? All government policy is wrong

226
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,528
不过执行非常圆满
frightfully well carried out!

227
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,966
你有听过公务员为原则问题辞职吗?
Have you known a civil servant resign on principle?

228
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,609
当然没有 您怎能这么说
I should think not! What an appalling suggestion!

229
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,607
我第一次完全意识到了
For the first time, I fully understand

230
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,889
你纯粹关注手段 而非结果
that you are purely committed to means and not ends!

231
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,520
大臣 对我和我所有同僚来说
As far as I'm concerned, and all my colleagues,

232
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,445
手段和结果是一码事
there is no difference between means and ends.

233
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:41,968
你真这么以为 汉弗莱 你会下地狱的
If you believe that, Humphrey, you will go to hell.

234
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:48,204
大臣 没想到您还有神学倾向
Minister, I had no idea you had a theological bent.

235
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:54,128
你是个道德真空      这是您说的 大臣
You are a moral vacuum. If you say so, Minister.

236
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,649
您的午餐约会时间到了 大臣      你不吭声 伯纳
Time for your lunch appointment. You're keeping very quiet

237
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:02,168
你会怎么处理?      我会不吭声 大臣
What would you do about all this? I would keep very quiet.

238
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:06,604
大臣 那军售的事就到此为止?
So may we drop this matter of arms sales?

239
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,000
不 不能到此为止
No, we may not!

240
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:11,005
我要私下里通报首相
I'm gong to tell the Prime Minister personally.

241
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,003
给我预约 伯纳
Make an appointment, Bernard.

242
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:15,970
这种事首相一定想了解
This is the sort of thing he wants to know about.

243
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:20,410
我保证 大臣 这种事他一定不愿了解
I assure you, this is the sort of thing he wants not to know about.

244
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:23,207
我们走着瞧
We shall see about that.

245
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,210
那就走着瞧
Indeed we will.

246
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,244
怎么了 伯纳?
What's the matter, Bernard?

247
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,165
没事 汉弗莱爵士      你好像不开心
Nothing really, Sir Humphrey. You look unhappy.

248
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,607
我在想也许大臣是对的
I was wondering if the minister was right.

249
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:39,206
不大可能 哪件事?
Very unlikely. What about?

250
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:40,930
手段和目的
About ends and means.

251
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,970
我也会变成道德真空吗?
Will I end up as a moral vacuum, too?

252
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:48,802
我希望会的 伯纳
Oh, I hope so, Bernard.

253
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,047
如果你努力的话
If you work hard enough.

254
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,881
我觉得挺泄气的
Makes me feel rather downcast.

255
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,486
如果我们的工作是执行政策
If it’s our job to carry out government policies,

256
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,324
我们不该相信它们吗?
shouldn’t we believe in them?

257
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:03,211
哦 真是异想天开
Oh, what an extraordinary idea!

258
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,082
怎么?      伯纳
Why? Bernard...

259
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:10,484
我过去30年服务了11届政府
I have served 11 governments in the past 30 years.

260
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,927
如果我相信所有那些政策
If I'd believed in all their policies,

261
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:17,324
我会强烈反对加入共同市场
I'd have been committed to keep out of Common Market,

262
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:20,052
又强烈同意加入共同市场
and passionately committed to joining it.

263
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,171
我会坚信钢铁应该国营
convinced of the rightness of nationalising steel

264
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:26,971
并且私营 并且收归国营
and of denationalising it and renationalising it.

265
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,405
死刑呢?
Capital punishment?

266
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:33,087
我会热烈支持保留 又强烈要求废止
I'd have been a fervent retentionist and an ardent abolitionist.

267
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:35,720
我会追随凯恩斯主义 以及弗里德曼主义
I'd have been a Keynesian and a Friedmanite,

268
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,201
主张保留并取消文法学校
a grammar school preserver and destroyer,

269
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,762
狂热于国有化 醉心于私有化
a nationalisation freak and a privatisation maniac,

270
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:46,687
不过总之 我会语无伦次 并且精神分裂
I would have been a stark-staring raving schizophrenic!

271
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,408
那您相信什么?
So what do we believe in?

272
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:53,326
眼下 伯纳 我们相信要阻止大臣
At this moment, Bernard, we believe in stopping the minister

273
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,722
去通报首相
from informing the Prime Minister.

274
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:59,567
可为什么?      因为一旦首相知道了
But why? Because once the Prime Minister knows,

275
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:02,724
就得展开调查 就像水门事件
there will have to be an enquiry, like Watergate.

276
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:07,408
一个小泄密牵出一连串恐怖的大事件
A trivial break-In led to one ghastly revelation after another

277
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,450
终于倒下了一位总统
and finally the downfall of a president.

278
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:14,287
这是条铁律 不要去揭烂疮疤
The golden rule is don't lift lids off cans of worms.

279
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:18,001
是 汉弗莱爵士      "事物是普遍联系的"
No, Sir Humphrey. Everything is connected to everything else.

280
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,732
谁的名言?      内阁秘书?
Who said that? The Cabinet Secretary

281
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,206
差不多了 其实是列宁
Nearly right. Actually, it was Lenin.

282
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:30,406
怎样阻止内阁大臣找上首相?
How do you stop a Cabinet Minister talking to a Prime Minister?

283
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,484
问得好 你来说      我不知道
Interesting question. You tell me. I don't know.

284
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:36,530
想办法 伯纳 你不是前途无量嘛
Work it out. You're supposed to be a high-flier.

285
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:41,527
还是前途有量 推一步才动一步?
Or a low-flier supported by occasional gusts of wind?

286
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:48,207
您不能阻止大臣见首相 对吧?
Well, you can't stop the minister seeing the PM, can you?

287
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,569
我不能      首相私人办公室也不能
I can't. Nor can the private office at No. 10.

288
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,963
正确      必须找个高层人士
Correct. It must be someone high up in government.

289
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:57,771
思路不错      接近首相的
Getting warmer. Someone close to the PM.

290
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,765
能吓倒大臣们的...
Someone who can frighten the minister...

291
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,924
总组织秘书?      漂亮 你学到了不少
The Chief Whip? Excellent, you've learnt a lot.

292
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:07,641
那要怎么组织呢?      什么?
So, how do you crack the whip? I'm sorry

293
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,650
怎样才能发动组织秘书?
How do you mobilise the Chief Whip?

294
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:16,169
大臣要我给首相私人办公室打电话预约
I'm to phone the PM's private office for an appointment,

295
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:19,324
所以如果您跟内阁秘书打个招呼
so if you had a word with the Cabinet Secretary,

296
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,722
他跟日程秘书打个招呼
and he had a word with the diary secretary,

297
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,531
他俩都跟组织秘书办公室打个招呼
and they all had a word with the Whip’s office...

298
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,363
那么等大臣到那里
then when the minister arrived,

299
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:31,365
组织秘书可以告诉他首相很忙
the Whip could meet him and say the PM is busy

300
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:35,002
让他来接待大臣
and asked him to have a word with the minister instead.

301
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,848
漂亮 伯纳
Excellent, Bernard.

302
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:41,644
你应该去学工程
You should have taken a degree in engineering!

303
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:46,367
你干什么?      您不是要找内阁秘书嘛
What are you doling? You wanted the Cabinet Secretary.

304
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,525
我是要找 不过你作为大臣私人秘书
I do, indeed. Now, do you, as the minister's private secretary,

305
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:54,685
觉得要把刚才的对话通报大臣吗?
feel obliged to tell the minister of this conversation?

306
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,689
什么对话?
What conversation?

307
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,604
很好 伯纳 你一定能成为道德真空的
Well done, Bernard. You'll be a moral vacuum yet!

308
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:07,500
(首相办公室)

309
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,290
啊 吉姆
Ah, Jim.

310
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:16,410
老朋友 见到你真高兴
My dear chap, how nice to see you.

311
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,483
维克 我是来找首相的
Vic, I was hoping to see the Prime Minister.

312
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:19,641
对
Yes.

313
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:23,282
首相今天很忙 要我来接待你
The PM's rather busy today. Asked me to see you instead.

314
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,012
抱歉 维克 这不是组织秘书的事
Vic, it’s not a matter for the Chief Whip.

315
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:30,484
对 首相要我了解情况 写个背景摘要
The PM asked me to write a background note.

316
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,483
给他省时间
Save time later.

317
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:40,451
好吧 我听到些很耸动的消息
Well, I've been given some pretty dramatic information.

318
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,041
接着说
Go on.

319
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:45,045
意大利恐怖分子能够得到
The Italian Red Terrorists are being supplied

320
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:47,168
顶级机密的炸弹引爆器
with top secret bomb detonators

321
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:50,449
我国制造的 产自政府工厂
made in this country, in a government factory.

322
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:53,659
你觉得应该告诉首相?
You should tell the PM?

323
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,000
对 首相也负责国家安全
Yes, the PM's head of security.

324
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:59,966
我不觉得这需要麻烦首相 到此为止吧
I don't think it’s anything to burden the PM with. Let's hold it over.

325
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,522
你说全忘掉?      这是我的建议
Forget all about it? That's my recommendation.

326
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:08,040
抱歉 维克 我不同意 必须通报首相
I'm sorry, Vic, I can't accept it. The PM must be told.

327
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:13,041
如果首相知道 就必须展开调查      对
If the PM is told, there'd have to be an enquiry.

328
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:16,602
可能揭露出其他不良的 甚至恶劣的政府
Perhaps revealing other undesirable, even hostile, governments

329
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,161
也买到了英国军火
had been supplied with British-made arms.

330
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,321
真的?
Seriously?

331
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,451
可能吧 会让内阁同僚们很难堪
Might be highly embarrassing to our Cabinet colleagues,

332
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:29,447
外交大臣 国防大臣 经贸大臣 还有首相本人
Defence Secretary, Trade Secretary, and to the PM personally.

333
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,251
对 有时候坚持正义会很难堪
Doling the right thing might be embarrassing sometimes,

334
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:35,448
那也不能就不坚持了
but that's no reason for not doling it.

335
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,962
你知道也卖给叙利亚 智利 伊朗吧?
You know we already sell arms to Syria, Chile, Iran?

336
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,488
对 官方批准的      对 你赞成他们的用法?
it’s officially approved. You like what they do with them?

337
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,371
显然 不完全赞成
Well, obviously not entirely.

338
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,491
军火生意要么做 要么不做
Either you're in the arms business or you’re not!

339
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:53,247
如果做生意是要武装恐怖分子
If being in it means arming terrorists,

340
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:56,370
我们得退出 这不道德      好 真伟大
we should be out, it’s immoral. Oh, great!

341
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,171
真伟大
Great!

342
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:02,162
让十万英国工人失业就很道德啰?
Is it moral to put 100,000 British workers out of a job?

343
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:05,449
出口额呢? 一年两百万 直接的
And exports, two billion a year gone, for starters.

344
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,646
选票呢? 你觉得政府
And votes? Where do you think the government

345
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:10,564
把军火订单下在哪里?
places those weapons contracts?

346
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:14,691
当然在边缘选区      正是
In marginal constituencies, obviously. Exactly.

347
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:19,084
我只是说我既然知道了 得告诉首相
Now that I know, the Prime Minister must be told.

348
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,004
为什么?      为什么?
Why? Why?

349
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:23,163
就因为你闻到了臭气
Just because you've caught something nasty,

350
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:26,449
就得把大家都熏一通吗?
why do you have to breathe over everyone?

351
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,932
你在内阁还满意吧?
Are you happy in the Cabinet?

352
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:32,652
当然满意      还想留在里面吗?
Yes, of course I am! Do you want to stay in it?

353
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:36,770
那不得了
Well, then?

354
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,605
抱歉 维克 可我有我的职责
Sorry, Vic, but there is such a thing as duty.

355
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,969
有时候人得听从良心
Sometimes one must follow one's conscience.

356
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,281
老天爷
For God’s sake!

357
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,922
你那点良心非得这样招摇?
Must you flash about your petty little conscience?

358
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:51,242
你觉得别人都没良心吗?
Don't you think anybody else has got one?

359
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:55,524
你对政府存亡有没有良心?
Have you no conscience for the government?

360
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:56,727
当然有
Of course!

361
00:20:56,892 --> 00:21:01,283
首相就要签署一个国际反恐公约了
The PM is signing an international anti-terrorist agreement.

362
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:04,205
我不知道      你不知道的多了
I didn’t know. There's a lot you don't know.

363
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:08,331
你就不明白 维护大政方针 比出口
Can't you see it’s essential to deal with major policy

364
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,211
几支小枪给恐怖分子重要得多吗?
rather than a few arms exporters and terrorists?

365
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:14,648
对 肯定的 几小股恐怖分子
Yes, I suppose it is just a couple of terrorist groups.

366
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:18,168
杀不了多少人 是吧?      肯定的
Can't kill that many people, can they? Suppose not!

367
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:22,644
而你想以道德泛滥把这一切都淹掉
And you want to blow it all in a fit of moral self-Indulgence!

368
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:29,567
再说 既然首相考虑让你接掌外交部
The PM thinking about you as the next Foreign Secretary

369
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:34,410
你说真的?
Do you mean that?

370
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,040
老天啊
Good Lord!

371
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:42,087
你想壮烈牺牲的话 去展开调查好了
So if you want to martyr yourself, go for an enquiry.

372
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:46,131
尽情毁掉我们奋斗几年的成果吧
Feel free to jeopardise everything we've worked for all these years.

373
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,010
不不 这确实很可怕
No, no. Obviously it’s appalling

374
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,403
意大利恐怖分子拿到了英国军火
If Italian terrorists are getting hold of British weapons,

375
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:55,963
可你说了 为了保持忠诚 顾全大局
but there is such a thing as loyalty, the common purpose.

376
00:21:56,132 --> 00:22:00,523
我想这个问题必须正确看待
I suppose one must see these things in a proper perspective.

377
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:03,650
如果关系到国防部 经贸部
If it was the Ministry of Defence, Board of Trade.

378
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:06,770
对对 国防部的事 经贸部的事
Ministry of Defence, Board of Trade problem.

379
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,321
外交部的事 这下我明白了
Foreign Office problem. I can see that now.

380
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:12,211
那我们就暂时到此为止?
So we can hold it over for the time being?

381
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,603
总不能让首相心烦或者难堪嘛
Don’t want to upset and embarrass the PM!

382
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:18,570
当然不行 绝对不行 对
Absolutely not. Definitely not. No.

383
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,568
真抱歉我提出来
Sorry I mentioned it.

384
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,724
你不错
Good man!

385
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:30,561
所以我权衡之后 觉得还是不管的好
So I thought on balance It was best to leave it at that.

386
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,688
马蜂窝不能捅
Let sleeping dogs lie...

387
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,843
为了大家好
in the wilder interest.

388
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:37,606
做忠诚的政府官员
As a loyal member of the government.

389
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:41,529
揭烂疮疤没什么好处
Nothing to be gained. Opening a can of worms.

390
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,808
可少校说他们是恐怖分子
The major said they were terrorists.

391
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:45,965
对 可是...
Yes, well...

392
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,010
我们也轰炸德累斯顿 大家都是恐怖分子
We bombed Dresden. We're all terrorists.

393
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:50,161
不是
No.

394
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,922
我就打个比方
I mean metaphorically.

395
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,721
你该见见组织秘书 他绝对是
You should meet the Chief Whip. He certainly is!

396
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:59,764
可英国有人送炸弹给刽子手
Someone in Britain’s giving bombs to murderers.

397
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,126
是卖 不是送
Selling, not giving.

398
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,806
那就有理啦?      说真的 安妮
That makes it Ok? Be serious, Annie.

399
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:06,566
发起调查可能牵出别的事
An investigation might uncover all sorts.

400
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:09,929
懂了 一人犯法就展开调查
I see. Investigate If you can catch one criminal,

401
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:11,684
众人犯法就得捂盖子
but not if you might catch lots!

402
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:14,924
如果这些人是你内阁同僚 就得捂
If they're your Cabinet colleagues, you're right!

403
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:18,285
政府运作很复杂的 安妮
Government is a very complex business, Annie.

404
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,568
到处都是矛盾冲突
There are so many conflicting considerations.

405
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,882
比如是做正确的事呢 还是犯错
Whether to do the right thing or wrong thing.

406
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,963
正是 不...
Exactly. No...

407
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:27,726
你要我怎么办?
What do you suggest I do?

408
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:30,326
捍卫道德原则      怎么捍卫?
Take a moral stand. How

409
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,768
以辞职威胁      他们会接受的
Threaten resignation. They'd accept it!

410
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:35,888
然后我去哪?
Then where would I be?

411
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:39,965
要是我下了台 就再也做不了好事了
If I'm gone, I'm not in a position to do any good any more.

412
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,531
你现在也没做好事嘛
You're not doling good now.

413
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,126
辞职只能安慰你我的良心
Resignation may be a sop to our consciences,

414
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,931
不能阻止意大利恐怖分子用英国炸弹
but it won’t stop terrorists getting British bombs.

415
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,289
可以把你知道的公开啊      我知道什么?
It might if you tell what you know. What do I know

416
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,645
我没有证据 我知道有这回事
I've no hard facts. I know it’s gong on

417
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,201
因为没人否认 但这不是证据
because nobody's denied it, but that's not proof.

418
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,962
你看不出吗? 我进退两难
Can't you see? I'm in a real fix.

419
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:02,568
我看你还没意识到你有多难
I don't think you realise just how real a fix you're in.

420
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,404
这封信今天到的
This letter arrived today.

421
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:07,322
桑德斯少校写的
From Major Saunders.

422
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:13,291
"亲爱的哈克先生 多谢接见我"
"Dear Mr Hacker. Thank you for seeing me.

423
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,524
"我如释重负 我已经告诉您"
Such a relief to have told you about the supply

424
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:19,365
"英国武器卖给意大利恐怖分子的事"
of British weapons to Italian terrorists.

425
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:23,567
"相信您会信守承诺 采取行动"
I know you will act upon this information as you promised

426
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:26,451
"热切期待看到您的对策"
and I look forward to seeing some action taken."

427
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:28,565
你瞧
You see?

428
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,446
傻眼了吧 桑德斯少校可以昭告天下
What will you do when Major Saunders tells the world

429
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,762
说他通报给了你 你无动于衷
he told you about it and you did nothing?

430
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,408
这是复印件 原件在他那
It's a photocopy. He's got the original.

431
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,291
是挂号信 你还不能说没收到
It was recorded delivery, so you did get it.

432
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,486
我上钩了
I'm trapped!

433
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,891
完全上钩了
Completely trapped!

434
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,806
不能告诉首相 也不能不告诉首相
I can't tell the PM, I can't not tell the PM.

435
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:48,961
明白了
I see.

436
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:52,249
大臣 不能用罗德西亚(津巴布韦)办法吗?
Might we not use the Rhodesia Solution?

437
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,889
伯纳 你太有长进了
Bernard, you excel yourself!

438
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,881
当然 大臣 罗德西亚办法
Of course, Minister, the Rhodesia Solution!

439
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:01,168
那是什么?      石油制裁的事
What's that? Oil sanctions.

440
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:04,927
有人告诉某政府要员 英国公司在破坏制裁
A member of the government was told about sanction-busting.

441
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,764
他怎么办?      通报首相
What did he do? Told the PM.

442
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:10,208
他用首相听不见的方法告诉首相
He told the PM in a way the PM didn’t hear him.

443
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:15,651
哦 你要我在投票厅里咕哝一句?
Oh. Do you mean I should mumble it in the Division lobby?

444
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:19,282
不 大臣 写个便条      用浅色铅笔?
No, Minister, you write a note. Very faint pencil?

445
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,205
请具体些      大臣 显而易见
Please, be practical. it’s awfully obvious.

446
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,330
您要写张容易被误解的便条
Write a note susceptible of misinterpretation.

447
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:26,481
哦 是吗
Oh, I see!

448
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,406
"亲爱的首相 我发现意大利恐怖分子"
"Dear Prime Minister, I believe Italian Red Terrorists

449
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,006
"能拿到英国机密炸弹引爆器"
have secret British bomb-making equipment."

450
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:34,890
这要怎么误解?
How do you misinterpret that?

451
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:37,612
没法误解 所以不这样写
You can't. So you don't write that.

452
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:41,890
风格要慎重 不提炸弹或恐怖分子
Circumspect style with no mention of bombs or terrorists.

453
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:45,886
这就难了 还能剩下什么?      伯纳 记下来
Isn't that what it’s all about? Bernard, write this down.

454
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:49,203
"最近我私下里得知一些消息"
"My attention has been drawn to information

455
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:52,967
"显示可能有人违反..."
which suggests possible irregularities under..."

456
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:56,807
"1939(丙)进出口和海关权力法案第一条"
Section 1 of the Export Powers Defence Act 1939c.

457
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,564
谢谢 伯纳
Thank you, Bernard.

458
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:02,520
然后您说 别的什么人得采取措施
Somebody else should do something about it.

459
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:06,241
"证据显示也许有必要进一步了解"
"Evidence suggests there may be a case for further investigation

460
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:09,449
"以便决定是否要展开调查"
to establish whether enquires should be put in hand."

461
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:11,489
然后你再放个烟幕
Then you smudge it all over.

462
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:16,563
"然而必须强调 已知情报有限"
"It should be stressed that available information is limited

463
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:20,520
"事实难以切实确立和把握"
and facts could be difficult to establish with any certainty."

464
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,889
懂了      就算展开调查 您也清白无辜
If there's an enquiry, you'd be in the clear

465
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:26,202
谁都理解日理万机的首相
and everybody would understand the busy PM

466
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:28,567
也许没听出暗示
might not have grasped the implications.

467
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:32,645
当然听不出 太含糊了      谢谢 大臣
They certainly would! That's most unclear. Thank you, Minister!

468
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:35,690
然后 您送这封信到十号
You arrange for the letter to arrive at No. 10

469
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,446
要在首相出国参加首脑峰会前夕
on the day the PM has an overseas summit!

470
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:41,001
于是又搞不清是首相
So there is also doubt about whether it was the PM

471
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:43,402
还是代理首相读到它
or the acting PM who read the note.

472
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:45,722
这样联络就切断了
It's seen as a breakdown in communication,

473
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:48,326
人人都清白 可以各行其是了
everyone's cleared and can get on with things.

474
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:51,848
包括恐怖分子      没错...伯纳
Including the Red Terrorists! Exactly... Bernard!

475
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,812
告诉你政府怎么回事
I'll tell you about government.

476
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:58,805
你总得做对的事
You must always try to do the right thing.

477
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:02,760
可是不能叫人发现
But you must never let anybody catch you trying to do it

478
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:05,810
因为做对就是做错 对吧?
because doling right’s wrong. Right?

479
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:10,284
别喝了吧 亲爱的      还没见底呢
You had enough, darling? There's left in the bottle.

480
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:14,250
不 政府要的是原则
No, the thing about government Is principle.

481
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:18,610
原则就是你不能捅马蜂窝...
And the principle Is you mustn't rock the boat...

482
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:23,129
不然会害到一堆小小的良心
because if you do, all the little consciences will fall out.

483
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,167
你们必须扯在一根绳上
And you must all hang together.

484
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:30,928
不然就会被分头吊死 (富兰克林)
Because if you don't hang together, you'll all be hanged separately.

485
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,447
我不扯着他们就得吊死
I'm hanged if I'll be hanged!

486
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:39,684
告诉你 搞政治就是要帮助别人
You know... politics is about helping others.

487
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,409
就算帮的是恐怖分子
Even if that means helping terrorists.

488
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:49,371
恐怖分子也是别人吧 不是我们自己吧
Terrorists are others, aren't they? Not us, are they?

489
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:51,201
不是
No.

490
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:54,370
而且你得时刻跟着良心走
And you must always follow your conscience,

491
00:27:54,532 --> 00:27:56,921
不过也得知道你要朝哪走
but you must know where you're gong.

492
00:27:57,852 --> 00:28:00,525
所以不能总跟着良心
So you can't follow your conscience.

493
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:04,128
因为它可能不跟你往一块走
'Cause it may not be gong the same way that you are.

494
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:08,005
干了...就像我
Empty... Like me.

495
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:12,682
我也是道德真空      开心点 亲爱的
I'm a moral vacuum. Cheer up, darling!

496
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:16,367
白厅里出不了好东西 你已经尽力了
Nothing good comes out of Whitehall. You did what you could.

497
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,444
你不是说真的      是真的
You don't really mean that. I do.

498
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:23,400
我跟汉弗莱他们一回事      绝对不是
I'm just like Humphrey and the rest. That's not true!

499
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:27,281
他的是非观已经没有了 你还有
He's lost his sense of right and wrong. You've still got yours.

500
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:30,808
有吗?      只是不常用罢了
Have I? it’s just that you don't use it much.

501
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,808
你就像个酒鬼牧师
You're a sort of whisky priest,

502
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,850
你犯错的时候 至少明知是错的
you at least know when you've done the wrong thing.

503
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:39,651
酒鬼牧师      是啊
Whisky priest? That's right.

504
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:42,330
好
Good.

505
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:46,321
我们再开一瓶      家里没有了
Let's open another bottle. We haven't got one.

506
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:48,370
那是你以为
That's what you think!

507
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:55,044
谁说白厅出不了好东西?
Who said nothing good ever came out of Whitehall?

508
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,846
你也来一杯?      是 大臣
You want one? Yes, Minister
