00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,503
家丑外扬

00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,446
第7项 第7项是什么?
Item 7. What is item 7?

6
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,916
请允许我重申一遍 大臣
Well, if I may just recapitulate...

7
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,086
抱歉 大臣
Sorry, Minister.

8
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:53,445
您还没说的议程是不能重申的
You can't actually recapitulate an item if you haven't started it yet.

9
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:59,005
多谢 伯纳 没你我们可完了 我接着说?
Thank you. Where would we be without you? May I continue?

10
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,477
重申一遍上次会议 会议纪要
Recapitulating on our last meeting and the minutes,

11
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:06,560
您当然收到了?      当然 对对

12
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:09,446
什么纪要 汉弗莱?
Er... what minutes, Humphrey?

13
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:13,600
对南德贝郡政府进行纪律处分的提案
Disciplinary action against the South Derbyshire local authority.

14
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:18,761
啊 对...提醒我一下好吗 伯纳?
Ah, yes... Will you remind me, Bernard?

15
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,316
他们没完成法定报表
They failed to complete their statutory returns

16
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:23,717
也没上交统计资料
and supply us with statistical information.

17
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:26,879
对了 我们怎么办?      怎么处分?
What'll we do? The action we can take?

18
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:28,526
大臣出面指责
A rebuke from the minister,

19
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,042
发表声明宣布他们玩忽职守
press statement about their incompetence,

20
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:34,916
扣发补贴 以及最终手段 您知道的
the withholding of grants or ultimately, as you are fully aware...

21
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,078
是 当然知道
Yes, of course.

00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,805
好
Good.

什么我知道的?
I'm fully aware of what?

24
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:45,995
什么?      我知道什么?
What? What am I fully aware of?

25
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:52,247
我还真不知道      你说的 最终手段
I mean... You said, ultimately, as I am fully...

26
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,797
最终手段 把郡政府告上法庭 抱歉
Ultimately, taking the local authority to court. Sorry.

27
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,764
有这么严重吗?
Is it that serious?

28
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:00,487
严重? 这是灭顶之灾      为什么?
Serious? it抯 catastrophic! Why?

29
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,639
如果地方政府都不按要求交报表
If local authorities don't send us statistics,

30
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,321
政府数据就纯属胡说了      怎么?
government figures will be a nonsense.

31
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:10,844
不完整啊      政府数据本来就是胡说
They'll be incomplete. Government figures are a nonsense.

32
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,521
大概汉弗莱爵士想确认
I think Sir Humphrey wants to ensure

33
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,757
它们是纯的胡说
they're a complete nonsense.

34
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,398
我是说...
I mean... er...

35
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,764
干吗拿南德贝开刀?
Why should we make an example of South Derbyshire?

36
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:26,284
您干吗反对 那个郡议会归您的党派管?
Do you object because the council抯 controlled by your party?

37
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,846
没有没有
Oh, no, no, no.

38
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:32,319
绝对没有 不过不能找个反对党的选区么?
No, no, no. But couldn抰 we just... pick on an opposition council?

39
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,797
大臣      南德贝真有那么糟?
Oh, Minister! Is South Derbyshire all that bad?

40
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:41,081
惨不忍睹 他们不交蓝表格
Terrible! They won't return their blue forms!

41
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:45,479
去年的就业率问卷也没搞完
They haven't completed employment trends questionnaire!

42
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:49,640
少数民族统计征询表是手写的
ethnic personnel breakdown request in longhand

43
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,162
还写在部门公函背面
on the back of a departmental circular!

44
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:58,117
社工修订分析表两个季度没交
We haven't had their social analysis for two quarters

45
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:01,085
还有资料处理量化表
or their data-processing appropriation tables!

46
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,602
真没想法了 坏透了
They're unbelievable! Really evil!

47
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,476
怎么 就因为少交几套表?
What, because they won't return their forms in triplicate?

48
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,719
对哦 真不知德贝人怎么活
I don't see how life can go on in Derbyshire!

49
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:11,922
正是 大臣
Exactly, Minister.

50
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:15,682
真是无能到登峰造极了
They really are in a class of their own for incompetence.

51
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:19,044
没一点成就吗?      有趣的是...
Have they no redeeming features? It is fascinating...

52
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,802
没问题的话 大臣 我们直接下处分了
If that's all right, we can take coercive action.

53
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:26,164
大臣可能...      您同意了 大臣?
The minister might like to know... You approve?

54
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,927
不好下手 他们是朋友
Yes, it抯 a difficult one. They're friends.

55
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,760
他们不是优秀政府的朋友
They are no friends of good administration.

56
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,155
好 给我24小时
Well, give me 24 hours.

57
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,716
我去党内协调一下
I'll have to square the party organisation.

58
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:38,639
让党主席受邀
Get the chairman invited

59
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,879
去10号里喝个小酒
to one of those drinky-do's at Number 10.

60
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:44,607
缓冲一下 还有事吗?
Soften the blow. Right, anything else?

61
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,076
没有 似乎都完成了
No, I think that seems to be all.

62
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,601
理查 我有事要请教 有空吗?     当然
Richard, I need your advice, if you can spare a moment.

63
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,402
伯纳 我不太乐意
Bernard, I'm not happy about...

64
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,478
处分南德贝
disciplining South Derbyshire.

65
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,002
怎么了 大臣?      直觉
Why not, Minister? Instinct.

66
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:10,036
卡赖特博士似乎想告诉我什么
Dr Cartwright seemed to be trying to tell me something.

67
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:11,720
我想去看看他
I think I'll drop in on him.

68
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,843
还是别去吧 大臣      怎么?
I wouldn't do that. Why not?

69
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:18,000
一般大臣想知道什么 要叫人呈上来
If ministers want to know will be brought to their notice.

70
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,716
要是他们自己去打听 没准会...
If they go out looking for information, they might...

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,196
打听出来?      对
Find it? Yes.

72
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:29,480
汉弗莱爵士很反感大臣到处串门
Sir Humphrey does not like ministers dropping in on people.

73
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:33,401
他管这叫"乱逛"      女皇也串门
Gong walkabout, he calls it. The Queen does it.

74
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,082
她不会进副秘书的门
She doesn't drop in on Under-Secretaries,

75
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:38,602
汉弗莱爵士的部门里不会
not in Sir Humphrey's department.

76
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,964
他在几号房?      我提出严正反对 大臣
What's his room number? I must advise you against this.

77
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,721
反对收到      4017号
Advice noted. Room 4017.

78
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,885
往下一层 左手第二走廊
Down one flight, second corridor on the left.

79
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:53,006
要是我48小时回不来 派搜索队来
If I'm not back in 48 hours, send out a search party!

80
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:57,640
你好 格拉汉 我是伯纳
Hello, Graham, it抯 Bernard.

81
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:01,117
告诉汉弗莱爵士 大臣刚出去乱逛了
Tell Sir Humphrey that the Minister抯 just gone walkabout.

82
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:03,482
对对 擅离职守
Yes, yes, AWOL.

83
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,476
我当然跟他说了 对
Well, of course I told him, yes.

84
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:11,640
我知道 你最好马上通知他
I know. I think you'd better let him know right away.

85
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:19,883
1 2 3 4 5
One... two... three... four... five...

86
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:25,041
6 7 8 9 10
six... seven... eight... nine... ten.

87
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:27,198
怎么搞的?
What's all this about?

88
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:31,679
大臣刚出了办公室而已
The minister抯 just left the office, that's all.

89
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:35,237
而已? 你说他跑到楼里去了?
That's all? Do you mean he's loose in the building?

90
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:37,646
怎么不通知我?
Why didn抰 you warn me?

91
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,446
我劝他别去 可他是大臣
I did advise him, but he is the minister.

92
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,077
没有禁止大臣接触下属的规定
There's no prohibition against ministers talking to their staff.

93
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:47,717
他找谁谈话 伯纳?      也许他只是心烦
Who's he talking to? Perhaps he was just restless.

94
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,366
如果大臣心烦 伯纳
If the minister抯 restless,

95
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,836
他可以去公园里喂鸭子
he can feed the ducks in St James's Park!

96
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:53,796
是 汉弗莱爵士
Yes, Sir Humphrey.

97
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,561
说吧 大臣在找谁谈话?
Tell me who the minister抯 talking to.

98
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:01,077
当然大臣想找谁都行吧
Well, surely the minister can talk to anyone.

99
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:07,083
伯纳 我正在写你的年度工作报告
Bernard... I'm in the middle of writing your annual report.

100
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,764
这项职责
Now, it is not a responsibility

101
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,680
你我都不希望我在完成期间
that either of us would wish me to discharge

102
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,156
心情不佳吧
whilst I am in a bad temper.

103
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,117
大臣在找谁谈话?
Who's the minister talking to?

104
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,759
也许您能指教我 汉弗莱爵士
Perhaps you could help me.

105
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:26,636
如果他是找外人 您当然得知道
I can see that you should know if he calls on an outsider.

106
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,480
但我不明白为什么要通知您
I fall to see why you should be informed

107
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:33,196
如果他只想...假如说
if he just wants to, to take a hypothetical example,

108
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,803
只想问卡赖特博士...
to... check a point with... Dr Cartwright...

109
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,686
谢了 伯纳 失陪了
Thank you, Bernard. Must fly.

110
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,963
4017房间      我知道
Room 4017. I know.

111
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,836
他们说的南德贝的事 是真的吗?
Are those things about South Derbyshire true?

112
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,567
我估计可能吧      这话怎讲?
They may be. What are you saying?

113
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,638
我只说南德贝郡是
I'm saying that South Derbyshire is

114
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,367
全国最高效的地方政府
the most efficient local authority in the UK.

115
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,519
最高效? 还要我把他们当最差的处分
I'm meant to tick them off for being the least.

116
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,006
看看数据
Look at the figures.

117
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:04,160
不是没上报吗?      没有
I thought they didn抰 send us any. No.

118
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:08,525
可他们自己记录得很好 就这些
But they keep their own records perfectly well. I'm gong on those.

119
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:14,675
全中部数他们失职率最低
They've got the lowest truancy record in the Midlands.

120

市政委员会行政开销最低

人员编制与个人收入比值最低

122
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,197
环境最好 卫生官员最少
The lowest number of environmental health officers.

123
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,564
什么卫生官员?      抓耗子的
What are those officers? Rat-catchers.

124
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,676
基本上所有儿童都能读写
Virtually all children can read and write,

125
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,566
虽然搞的是素质教育
even though they've had a progressive education.

126
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,763
对了 他们的社会福利人员
They've got the smallest establishment

127
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:38,440
在全国也是最少的
of social workers in the UK.

128
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:42,998
这是好事吗?      对 说明效率高
Is that supposed to be a good thing? Oh, yes. Sign of efficiency.

129
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,965
社工循环递增率 您看
Parkinson抯 Law of Social Work, you see.

130
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,038
就是说社会问题一增加
Social problems increase to occupy

131
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,517
社工也得全员出动 顾不上别的了
the number of social workers available to deal with them.

132
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,556
数据都对吗?      对的 我保证
And all these figures are Ok? Yes, I assure you.

133
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,718
理查 我正想...
Richard, I wonder if I...

134
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,758
是您呀 大臣
Good heavens, Minister.

135
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,966
汉弗莱 真巧啊      无巧不成书啊
Humphrey, what a coincidence. Yes, indeed, what a surprise!

136
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,322
对      对
Yes. Yes.

137
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,557
我正好...路过
I was just... passing.

138
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,765
路过?      对 路过
Passing? Yes, passing.

139
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,919
路过啊 您要去哪呢?
Oh, passing. And where were you gong?

140
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,123
我只是在...过路而已
I was just gong... past.

141
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:25,483
路过门口 卡赖特...理查门口
Past the door. Cartwright抯... Richard抯 door.

142
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,957
突然我就想 "咦...?"
And I thought..."Hello..."

143
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,997
还想了别的吗?
Did you think anything further?

144
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:37,438
我想 "都到门口了 何不打开门瞧瞧?"
Yes, I thought, "Why should I pass the door? Why not open it?"

145
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,881
思路不错 大臣 门就是干这个用的
Good thinking, that's what doors are for.

146
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,082
对
Right.

147
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,966
我刚好有些问题要澄清
There were some points I wanted to clear up.

148
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,924
好好 什么问题?
Oh, good, good. What points?

149
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:50,762
都是些小问题      小问题
Just a couple of odd points. Couple of odd points.

150
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:56,725
有多小?      其实也没多小
How odd? Oh... not all that odd.

151
00:08:56,887 --> 00:09:00,675
就开了个会     能跟您说句话吗 大臣?
We just had a meeting. Could I have a word with you?

152
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:04,044
当然可以 等我...      我说现在
Yes, of course, as soon as... No, I mean now.

153
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:07,643
好 说吧      不 上楼去您办公室
All right, carry on. No, upstairs in your office.

154
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,605
理查肯定不介意      不 上楼去 大臣
I'm sure Richard doesn't mind. No, upstairs.

155
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,601
卡赖特博士也不差这几分钟吧
I'm sure that Dr Cartwright can spare you for a few moments.

156
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,758
谢谢 理查 大臣您请
Thank you, Richard. Minister.

157
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,398
你先出去 伯纳
You may go, Bernard.

158
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:50,325
大臣 您这是要干什么?
Minister, what was all that in aid of?

159
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,762
我听到些有趣的事实
I have learnt some interesting facts.

160
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:56,317
我衷心希望您下不为例      你说什么?
I hope it does not happen again. I beg your pardon?

161
00:09:56,487 --> 00:10:00,036
您不能到处跟部里的人说话
You cannot speak to people in the department.

162
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,242
怎么不能?
Why not?

163
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:04,558
我不知他们说了什么 怎么给您提建议?
How can I advise you if I don't know what抯 said?

164
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,718
我必须掌握情况
I must know what is gong on.

165
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,526
您就是不能私下跟人谈话
You cannot have private conversations!

166
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:12,042
万一他们说的是假话呢?
You may be told things that are not true!

167
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,597
那你纠正嘛      万一是真话呢?
You can put me right. But they may be true!

168
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:21,245
不完全假 但有偏向 会误导您
Not entirely false, but misleading, open to misinterpretation.

169
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:25,605
我看你有事瞒着我      绝对没有 大臣
You're trying to keep things from me. Absolutely not, Minister.

170
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,203
要做好记录 要留下档案
Minutes must be taken, records must be kept.

171
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,518
您不会永远在这 我们也不会
You won't be here forever, Nor will we.

172
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,120
几年之后
in years to come...

173
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,926
要知道您说过什么 若卡赖特明天调走
If Cartwright were moved tomorrow,

174
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,647
信息要怎么核实?
how could we check information?

175
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,799
卡赖特明天不会调走      哦 是吗?
Cartwright won't be moved tomorrow. Oh, really?

176
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,116
邮报的安德鲁来找您 大臣
Alex Andrews from the Mall to see you.

177
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,926
且慢 伯纳 给我记到档案里
Ah, hang on. I'd like you to minute this.

178
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,647
什么都得归档 是吧
Everything must be minuted, you know.

179
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,877
坐下好吗 汉弗莱?
Sit down, won't you, Humphrey?

180
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,517
南德贝郡政府      等我记一下
Now South Derbyshire Council... Just a minute.

181
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,759
我是这么说的 南德贝郡政府
Yes, that's what I said. South Derbyshire.

182
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,920
卡赖特博士说那是全国最高效的
Dr Cartwright said it is the most efficient council in Britain.

183
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,885
他说低效吧      高效 汉弗莱
Inefficient, I think he means. Efficient, Humphrey.

184
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,321
经济实惠
Economical, effective.

185
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:14,036
只不过不想往白厅送报表而已
Just not interested in sending bits of blue paper to Whitehall.

186
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,596
可他们非送不可      为什么?
But they have to send them. Why?

187
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:22,160
法律要求的      他们不送 英国照样运转
It is a statutory requirement. And if they don't, Britain carries on.

188
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,965
南德贝照样运转
South Derbyshire carries on.

189
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,721
可如果他们不上报信息
But if they don't send us the information,

190
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,685
计划 批复申请
the plans and the requests for permission,

191
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,445
那还要我们干吗?
what are we here for?

192
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:36,045
问得好 要我们干吗?
Good question. What are we here for?

193
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:40,803
我们收集信息 审查计划 决定批不批申请
To collect information withhold or grant permission.

194
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,085
不然呢?      抱歉 大臣 我不明白
And if we didn抰? I'm sorry, Minister, I don't understand.

195
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,796
没有我们 也没这些事 那又如何?
If we weren't here and we didn抰 do it, what then?

196
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,003
对不起 大臣 我搞糊涂了
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

197
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,682
你的问题是 你只管手续 不看结果
You're concerned more with means than ends.

198
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:59,284
行政中没有结果 大臣 有也是恶果
There are no ends in administration, Minister, except loose ends.

199
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,278
行政代代相传
Administration is eternal!

200
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:04,200
永世长存      阿门
Forever and ever. Amen!

201
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:08,119
因为没结果 才有人说政府是个圈
Because there are no ends, they talk about government circles.

202
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:11,677
没错 伯纳 我们就在里头绕
Exactly, Bernard, which is what we抮e gong round in!

203
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:15,476
反正我不处分南德贝 会出洋相的
I won't discipline South Derbyshire. I'd look a complete idiot.

204
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,445
抱歉 大臣 这是您的工作
I'm sorry, Minister, but it抯 your job.

205
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:23,280
是说处分南德贝 您没有选择
To discipline South Derbyshire. You have no alternative.

206
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:26,519
财政部和内阁办公室一致要求
The Treasury and the Cabinet Office insist.

207
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:29,679
汉弗莱 我不同意 反正今天不行
I cannot agree to this. Not today, anyhow.

208
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:31,644
那就明天      不行 汉弗莱
Tomorrow, then. No!

209
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,116
抱歉 大臣 您好像没明白
I'm sorry, you don't seem to understand.

210
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,723
这由不得你我 这是法律
It is not up to you or to me. It is the law.

211
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:42,281
大臣 您该见邮报的人了      很好
I think you ought to talk to the Mall. Very well.

212
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:46,644
多谢 汉弗莱      多谢 大臣
Thank you, Humphrey. Thank you, Minister.

213
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:52,038
伯纳 伯纳      什么 大臣?
Bernard. Bernard. Yes, Minister?

214
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,357
汉弗莱怎么知道我去找卡赖特?
How did Sir Humphrey know I was with Dr Cartwright?

215
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,803
神的行事很难捉摸
God moves in a mysterious way.

216
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:08,683
我们搞清楚 汉弗莱不是神 好吗?
Let me make one thing perfectly clear. Humphrey is not God, Ok?

217
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:13,276
您去告诉他还是我来?
Will you tell him or shall I?

218
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:20,562
现在告诉我 他怎么知道的
Now, tell me how he knew where I was.

219
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:24,515
大臣 您对我说的话都绝对保密
Confidentially, everything you tell me Is in complete confidence

220
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,485
反过来 您当然也赞同
so equally, and I'm sure you appreciate this,

221
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:30,400
这个赞同不是赞同
and, by appreciate, I don't mean appreciate,

222
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,445
而是理解 汉弗莱爵士对我说的
I mean understand, that everything Sir Humphrey tells me

223
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:34,756
同样完全保密
Is also in confidence,

224
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:39,000
我对您说的要保密 我对汉弗莱爵士说的
as indeed everything I tell you and everything I tell Sir Humphrey

225
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,839
也完全保密
Is in complete confidence.

226
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,038
所以呢?
So?

227
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,879
所以秘密说来 我相信您完全理解
So, in confidence, I am confident you understand

228
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,561
我为汉弗莱爵士保密 为您保密
that for me to keep Sir Humphrey's confidence,

229
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,479
因此他和我的谈话
conversations between him and me

230
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:59,277
必须保密 就像您和我的谈话
must as confidential as conversations between you and me

231
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,642
完全保密 还是请安德鲁进来吧
are completely confidential.

232
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:08,763
安德鲁先生 大臣      谢谢 伯纳
Mr Andrews, Minister. Thank you, Bernard.

233
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,760
啊 艾利 你好吗?      你好 吉姆
Ah, Alex. Hello, Jim.

234
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,122
请坐      谢谢
Sit down. Thank you.

235
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,279
找我什么事?      需要你帮忙
What can I do for you? I need your help.

236
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:19,483
我在写一件奇谈
I've come across a fascinating story.

237
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:22,042
你知不知道你的政府
Do you realise that your government

238
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,005
正要拱手将价值4千万的
Is about to hand over 40 million-worth

239
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,682
住宅 建筑 港口和一个小机场
of housing, building, harbour Installations and an airstrip

240
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,042
白送给私营开发商?
to a private developer for nothing?

241
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:35,246
4千万 逗我玩吧?      凭童子军的荣誉担保
40 million? You're having me on! No, Scout's honour.

242
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,039
干吗找我 不是我干的吧?      不是
Why tell me? I didn抰 do it, did I? No.

243
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,118
这事说来话长
It goes back a long way.

244
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:48,758
30年前 国防部在苏格兰小岛租了块地
30 years ago, the Defence had a lease on a Scottish Island.

245
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:52,920
建了兵营 哨位 司令部 海港 机场
They put up billets, HQ block, the harbour, the airstrip.

246
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:56,682
现在租约到期了 地要还给原主人
And now the lease has expired, It reverts to the original owner.

247
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,644
他要开个度假村
He's opening up a holiday camp.

248
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:01,002
游艇码头 小别墅 员工宿舍
Yachting marinas, chalets, staff quarters.

249
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,123
都是现成的 他要发了
It's all there. He'll make a fortune.

250
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,677
不会吧 法律...      不 那是英格兰法
He can't do that. The law... No, that's English law.

251
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:09,042
这个合同遵循苏格兰法
This contract was made under Scottish law.

252
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:12,643
有个笨蛋没看出区别
Some idiot didn抰 realise the difference.

253
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:15,799
没我们事      啊 对
We're in the clear. Ah, yes.

254
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,165
邮报也不能把50年代的事怪到你头上
Even the Mall can't blame you For a cock-up in the early'50s.

255
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,363
这倒新鲜
Makes a change.

256
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,519
你找我干吗? 故事你都有了
What do you want from me? You've got your story.

257
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,645
迟到30年 新闻总是这么及时
30 years late. As quick with the news as ever!

258
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,957
对英国报界算不错啦
Still, not bad for Fleet Street!

259
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,845
对 明天见报
We're running it tomorrow,

260
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,680
可主编要我做个专题
but my editor wants me to do a feature,

261
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,839
查清原委 翻翻文件
find out how it happened, go through the files.

262
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,567
为什么?      前车之鉴啊
Why? There could be lessons for today.

263
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,844
也许还能挖出责任人
We might find out who is responsible.

264
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:49,080
有关系吗? 起草的一定是个小职员
Does it matter? It would抳e been handled by quite a junior official.

265
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,842
对 那是30年前 今天他可能身居高位
30 years ago. Today he could be in an important position.

266
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,795
没准是个大部门的常任秘书
He could be a Permanent Secretary running a great department,

267
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,516
手握几十亿磅公款
responsible for spending billons of pounds of public money.

268
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:05,078
应该不会      对 可我能看文件吧?
Pretty unlikely. Yes. But can I see the papers?

269
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,966
当然 我不能就这么给你
Of course, I can't just hand files over.

270
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,721
不过你说是30年的租约?
Didn抰 you say It was a 30-year lease?

271
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,526
过几星期你可以去找档案公署
You can get them from the Public Records Office

272
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,040
按30年解密规则
under the 30-yearrule.

273
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,198
对 我料你会这么说
Yes, I thought you'd say that,

274
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,882
但你得保证我能全部拿到
but I want a guarantee that I will get all of them.

275
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,199
国防部文件啊      得了 这又不是机密
Well, Defence papers... Come on, this is not top security.

276
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,278
听着 你竞选宣言里承诺
You made a manifesto commitment

277
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:31,360
你会告诉选民真相 考验来了
saying you'd tell voters the facts. This is a test case.

278
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,800
我要你保证
I want your guarantee

279
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,562
解密前所有资料原封不动
that no papers will be removed from the file before it抯 opened.

280
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,719
那是当然 有我在没人会搞鬼
I don't see why not. No skin off my nose.

281
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,559
这是承诺吗?      当然
Is that a promise?

282
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:46,322
真的承诺 不是竞选宣言里那种
A real promise, not the sort you put in your manifesto!

283
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:50,241
你就这毛病 别人答应你反而不信
The problem with you is you won't take yes for an answer!

284
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:55,923
不然我们就写 "大臣出尔反尔"
Otherwise we do the feature about ministers ratting on manifestos.

285
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:21,284
"政府玩忽职守 开发商大发横财"
"Developers' multimillion bonanza from Goverment error"

286
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,758
就这些 汉弗莱?
Is that the lot, Humphrey?

287
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:36,721
抱歉 似乎就这些了 大臣 谢谢
Oh, I'm sorry. That seems to be all, Minister, thank you.

288
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:41,085
对了 汉弗莱 你看了今早的邮报没有?
Did you see that story in the Mall this morning?

289
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:45,035
苏格兰海岛丑闻      我不记得
About the Scottish Island scandal. I'm not sure.

290
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,277
有人犯了个错
About some cock-up somebody made

291
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,200
30年前订错了租约
30 years ago about the terms of the lease.

292
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,597
似乎是有这么一篇
I believe I did glance at it.

293
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:56,680
4千万资产流失啊 这人可惨了
40 million down the tube! Somebody really boobed there!

294
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:02,004
不是你的部门吧      当然不是
It didn抰 happen in your department? Absolutely not.

295
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:06,558
真想知道是谁      我们永远不会知道了
I wonder who it was. That is something we shall never know.

296
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,036
档案里会有吧?
It'll be on the files.

297
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,846
事事都得归档 你总说的
Everything must be put in writing, as you always say.

298
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:17,643
对 准有那么一份 可查起来就难了
Well... somewhere, no doubt, but it would take ages to search.

299
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,399
没人会费那个劲
Not worth anyone's time.

300
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:23,162
这你错了 邮报想做个大专题
You may be wrong. The Mall want to do a big feature.

301
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:28,162
只等档案照30年规则解密 就几个星期
Papers are released under the 30-yearrule in a few weeks.

302
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,319
我承诺让他们随便查
I promised them a free run of all the files.

303
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,965
大臣      这没关系吧
Minister! it抯 all right, isn抰 it?

304
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,676
没关系? 关系重大啊
All right? It most certainly is not all right!

305
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:44,044
怎么不行      这不可能 不可思议
Why on earth not? it抯 impossible, it抯 unthinkable!

306
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,163
为什么?      这是最高机密
Why? it抯 top security!

307
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:50,244
几间营房?      秘密海军设施
A few barracks? Secret naval installations!

308
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,604
反潜艇系统 低空雷达站
Anti-submarine systems! Low-level radar towers!

309
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,086
你又不知道
You don't know that.

310
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:58,205
不...可海军基地里就有这些东西
That's the sort of thing those bases have.

311
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,962
会拆除的啊      档案里会提到
But they'd have been dismantled. The papers will have references!

312
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:05,483
老皇历了      我们得申请许可
Ancient history. We need to get clearances.

313
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,285
谁的许可?
Who from?

314
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:11,235
安全部门 军情五处 军情六处
Security implications! MI5! MI6!

315
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,241
国外势力 国家利益
Foreign powers! National interests!

316
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:20,720
得问盟国 军方高层 中情局 北约 东盟 莫斯科
Consult our allies! Top brass! CIA, NATO, SEATO, Moscow!

317
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:25,405
莫斯科? 你没事吧 汉弗莱
Moscow Are you all right, Humphrey?

318
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,037
不 没有莫斯科 我不是说莫斯科
Er, no, not Moscow. I didn抰 mean Moscow.

319
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:33,359
可这消息会严重伤害在世的人
But this information could seriously damage people still alive.

320
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:37,520
要是拟合同的人还在世 他活该倒霉
The people who drew up this contract ought to be damaged!

321
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:41,521
当然 不能包庇官员 绝对的
Oh, absolutely! No question of protecting officials! Of course not!

322
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,917
可是主管的大臣...
But... responsible ministers...

323
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:48,877
都30年了 汉弗莱 早换了一批人了吧
It's 30 years ago. in any case, weren't the other lot in office then?

324
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,084
没错      你着什么急?
Well, yes... Why are you so concerned?

325
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,676
没有没有 跟我无关
Oh, I'm not, no, no. Not me, personally,

326
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:59,884
可事关原则 先例 政策
but it抯 the principle, the precedent, the policy...

327
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:04,518
政策归我管 汉弗莱 我说行就行 好吗?
The policy is up to me and I've said yes, so it done. Ok?

328
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,924
汉弗莱怎么了?
What's the matter with Humphrey?

329
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:20,161
我没犯什么错吧?
I haven't done anything wrong, have I?

330
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:24,283
不会真有安全问题吧?
There aren't any security Implications, are there?

331
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,846
到底搞什么?
What's the problem?

332
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,964
我在自言自语吗?      不 大臣 我听着呢
Am I talking to myself? No, I'm listening.

333
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,480
怎么不回答?
Why don't you answer?

334
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:35,605
抱歉 我以为您这是设问句
I thought your questions were purely rhetorical.

335
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,327
我也不明白他紧张什么
I see no reason for him to be so anxious.

336
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,761
除非...
Unless...

337
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:45,965
你跟我想的一样吗?      我想不会 大臣
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I don't think so, Minister.

338
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,598
我什么都没在想
I'm not thinking anything, really.

339
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:52,398
我想我闻到耗子味了
I begin to smell a rat.

340
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:55,161
要我找卫生官员来吗?
Shall I get an environmental health officer?

341
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:02,244
汉弗莱在行政部干了多久?
How long has Sir Humphrey been here at Administrative Affairs?

342
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,001
从建部开始      那是什么时候?
Since it was founded. When was that?

343
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:09,240
1964年 就跟经济部一起...
1964. The same time they started the Department for Economic...

344
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,087
现在我跟您想的一样了
Now I think I'm thinking what you're thinking.

345
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,600
你在想什么?
And what are you thinking?

346
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,600
您在想 他1964年前在哪里
You're thinking, where was he before 1964?

347
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,564
花名册里有记载
It'll be in "Who's Who".

348
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:24,925
一定在别的部门 被网罗到行政部的
He must've been in another department and trawled for the DAA.

349
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:28,682
什么?      网罗 拿网子捞鱼
What? Trawled. Fished, caught in the net.

350
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,679
啊 找到了 我的天啊      怎么?
Ah, here we are. Oh, my God! What?

351
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:39,240
1950-56年 他是苏格兰事务部副主管
He was Assistant Principal at the Scottish Office.

352
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,646
从陆军部借调的
On secondment from the War Office.

353
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,479
地区合同承办官
Regional Contracts Officer.

354
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:51,763
30年前啊
30 years ago.

355
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,162
原来这名官员
So the official...

356
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:59,558
拱手送出4千万
who chucked away 40 million...

357
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,525
纳税人的钱的...
of taxpayers' money was...

358
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,562
真吓人
How frightful!

359
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:11,564
太可怕了 大臣      恐怖
it抯 awful, Minister. Dreadful.

360
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:16,966
所有档案几星期内就要解密了
And all the papers due for release in a few weeks' time.

361
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,760
叫汉弗莱马上回来
Get Humphrey to come back here at once.

362
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,121
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.

363
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:28,319
格拉汉 我是伯纳 大臣问汉弗莱爵士是否
The Minister wonders if Sir Humphrey could spare time

364
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:31,001
有空来开个会 几天之内
for a meeting sometime in the next few days.

365
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,364
马上      其实 就在今天之内
At once. In fact, sometime today is really...

366
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:38,520
马上      准确说 未来60秒之内
At once! Sometime during the next 60 seconds.

367
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,922
他这就过来      怎么 他没晕啊?
He's coming round now. Why? Did he faint?

368
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,523
不 他就...      这事很严重 伯纳
No, he's just, you know... This is serious, Bernard.

369
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,166
对 我知道
Yes, I know.

370
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:01,597
一点都不好笑      当然不好笑
This is no laughing matter. No, certainly not.

371
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:11,959
问题在于
The question is...

372
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,996
我要怎么处理呢?
how am I gong to deal with it?

373
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,398
依我看...      这回是设问句 伯纳
In my opinion... The question was rhetorical.

374
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:27,518
您找我 大臣?      汉弗莱 进来进来
You wanted a word, Minister? Humphrey, come in, come in.

375
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,244
抱歉 伯纳
Sorry, Bernard.

376
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:43,437
我在想苏格兰海岛丑闻的事
I've been thinking about this Scottish Island scandal.

377
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:47,680
真让人担心      我不觉得...
Very worrying. Well, I don't know...

378
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,565
你大概没意识到
You probably don't realise this,

379
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:53,163
可这责任人很可能还在做公务员
but that official could still be in the Civil Servlce.

380
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,238
应该不会      怎么不会?
Very unlikely. But why?

381
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:01,003
他当年大概20多岁 现在正好50多岁
He could've been in his mld-20s then, he'd be in his mld-50s now.

382
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,965
没准还当常任秘书了呢
Might even be a Permanent Secretary!

383
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:08,124
我真不觉得...      也是 你说的对
I hardly think... No, of course, you're right.

384
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:12,678
这么不靠谱的人怎能当常任秘书呢
Nobody who made a blunder become a Permanent Secretary.

385
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:18,160
总之我要调查到底      大臣 这种事查不到
I want an investigation. Can't find out that sort of thing.

386
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:19,555
当然查得到
Surely we can.

387
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,606
你说的 凡事都有记录 有档案
You said yourself that minutes are always made, records kept

388
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,564
在公务员系统里面
in the Civil Servlce.

389
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:28,605
现行合同的法律文件
And legal documents concerning a current contract

390
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,122
总不会丢掉吧
wouldn't have been thrown away.

391
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:37,326
大臣 用不用搞得这么严重呢?
Minister... aren抰 we making a little too much of this?

392
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,560
可能会毁掉一份光明前程 就为...
Possibly blighting a brilliant career because of a...

393
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,604
30年前一点小疏忽?
tiny slip 30 years ago?

394
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,725
反正 也没浪费很多钱嘛
After all, it抯 not such a lot of money wasted.

395
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,286
4千万磅?
40 million?

396
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,845
这个 您比比蓝光导弹
Well, not compared with Blue Streak,

397
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:56,477
TSR2轰炸机 三叉戟客机 协和飞机

艾塞克斯大学
the University of Essex.

404
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:20,205
对 我明白 不过它还是百倍地超出
I take your point, but it抯 still more, a hundred times more,

405
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,757
这名官员一辈子能挣的工资
than this official could ever have earned in his entire career.

406
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:28,842
因此我就交给你调查 找出谁干的
So I want you to look into it and find out who it was.

407
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:31,406
好吗?
Ok?

408
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,956
怎么了 汉弗莱?      大臣 有件事您得知道
Yes, Humphrey? There is something you ought to know.

409
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,679
什么 汉弗莱?
Yes, Humphrey?

410
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,125
被归置责任的这名官员的身份
The identity of the official whose alleged responsibility

411
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:52,959
其作出这件假定的疏忽
for this hypothetical oversight,

412
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:55,595
成为我们近来讨论的对象
as being the subject of recent discussion,

413
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,601
并未笼罩在密不透风的层层迷雾之中
Is not shrouded in quite such impenetrable obscurity

414
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,804
大异您基于早先信息作出的推断
as previous disclosures led you to assume.

415
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,561
一言以蔽之 追根究底
But not to put too fine a point on it...

416
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,162
我们讨论的这个人 也许您会吃惊
the individual in question is, It may surprise you to learn,

417
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:13,524
在您目前的谈话对象提到他时
one whom your present interlocutor...

418
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,642
通常会使用
Is in the habit of defining...

419
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,725
第一人称代词来指代
by means of the perpendicular pronoun.

420
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,278
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

421
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:34,681
这人是...我
It was... I.

422
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,924
汉弗莱
Humphrey!

423
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:43,164
不会吧      我有压力
No? I was under pressure!

424
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,797
我们工作过度 慌慌张张
We were overworked, there was panic!

425
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,242
议会就要质询了
Parliamentary questions tabled.

426
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,398
显然我没受过法律训练
Obviously I'm not a trained lawyer

427
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:57,083
不然不会派我管法务部门
or I wouldn't have been in charge of the Legal Unit!

428
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:01,246
都30年了 人无完人啊
30 years ago! Everybody makes mistakes!

429
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,319
好了 汉弗莱 我原谅你
Well, Humphrey... I forgive you.

430
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,198
谢谢您 大臣
Oh, thank you, Minister.

431
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,564
你怎么早不告诉我 汉弗莱?
Why didn抰 you tell me about this before?

432
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,366
我们俩之间总没有秘密吧?
We have no secrets from each other, have we?

433
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:22,206
这得由您说 大臣      不完全由我
That is for you to say, Minister. Well, not entirely.

434
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:25,086
不过 现在要怎么办?
Anyhow, what are we gong to do?

435
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,646
我会被媒体轰炸的
I'm gong to be roasted

436
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:30,083
如果我不把所有文件给邮报
If I don't release all those papers to the Mall.

437
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,679
也许我能采取些措施...
I might be able to do something about it...

438
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:36,077
要是手头没有其他麻烦的话
If I hadn't got this other worry on my plate.

439
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,238
什么其他麻烦?
What other worry

440
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:41,278
还是被媒体轰炸
Being roasted by the press

441
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:45,645
因为处分全国最高效的地方政府
for disciplining the most efficient council in Great Britain.

442
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:51,206
大臣 我一直在想南德贝的事
I've been thinking about South Derbyshire.

443
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:56,599
那敢情好      显然我们动不了法律
Oh, good. Obviously we can't change the law.

444
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,678
不过也许可以宽大为怀
Perhaps we might show them leniency,

445
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,042
私下跟行政长官提一句
a private word with the Chief Executive.

446
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,005
给他们个机会改过
Give them a chance to mend their ways.

447
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,362
这应该相当有用
That might help considerably.

448
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:10,122
那我怎么跟邮报解释失踪的文件?
How will I explain the missing documents to the Mall?

449
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,324
这个嘛 我们有种惯用手段对付...
Well, this is what we normally do in...

450
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,998

circumstances like these.

455
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:35,516
1967年冬天很恶劣吗?
Was 1967 a particularly bad winter?

456
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,040
不 那个冬天很不错
No, a marvellous winter.

457
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:41,085
我们丢失了无数棘手的文件
We lost no end of embarrassing files.

458
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,406
"运往伦敦途中遗失的某些记录"

459
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:48,764
"战争部并入国防部期间遗失的记录"
or when the War Office joined the Ministry of Defence,

460
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,522
"以及经正常程序抽出的报告 为了避免"
and the withdrawal of papers that could give grounds for an action

461
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,643
"可能引起的侵害隐私"
for libel or breach of confidence

462
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:57,685
"或冒犯友邦政府不满等情形"
or cause embarrassment to friendly governments."

463
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,638
貌似很情有可原嘛
Well, that's pretty comprehensive.

464
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:03,924
一般还能给他们剩下多少?
How many does that normally leave for them to look at?

465
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:08,522
实际剩下了多少?
How many does it actually leave?

466
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,281

Zero?

472

是 大臣
