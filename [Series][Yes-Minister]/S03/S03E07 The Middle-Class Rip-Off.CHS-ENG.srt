劫贫济富

5
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:43,262
(阿斯顿浪子队 0) (安卡索联队 2)

6
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,083
去会议室喝一杯 吉姆?     谢谢
Coming for a drink in the board room? Thanks.

7
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,163
趁足球俱乐部还在 好好享受吧
Ah, well, better enjoy it while the club's still here.

8
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:24,325
我们一向能撑过去的     这次不一样
We've always survived. it抯 different this time.

9
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,761
告诉他吧 布赖恩
Tell him, Brian.

10
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:29,522
昨晚我们和财政委员会紧急会面
We've had a meeting of the finance committee.

11
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:32,605
阿斯顿浪子队得算总帐了
Aston Wanderers will have to call in the Receiver!

12
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:36,243
你是说破产?     终场哨响了
You mean bankrupt? The final whistle.

13
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:39,041
就缺150万磅 吉姆
We need one-and-a-half million quid, Jim.

14
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,960
政府半分钟就浪费这么多
The government waste that every 30 seconds!

15
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,517
这什么话      知道大家怎么说吗 吉姆?
Oh, I say! You know what people are saying?

16
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,446
把地区议员捧成内阁大臣不合算
It's no good having a Cabinet Minister for an MP.

17
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:51,405
还不如留他在地方上 照顾选区
Better a local lad with time for his constituency.

18
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,086
胡扯     怎么?
That's absurd! Why?

19
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,841
议员进了内阁 好处多得很
There are advantages if an MP's in the Cabinet.

20
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,202
我们可没看到 是吧哈里
We haven't noticed them, have we, Harry

21
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:01,922
比如?      比如反映选区的民愿
Such as? It reflects well on the constituency.

22
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,322
结交有权有势的朋友
It's good to have powerful friends,

23
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,399
从高层施加影响 解危救难...
Influence in high places, a friend in need...

24
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,877
听着 朋友 现在需要150万磅救命钱
Listen, friend, what we need Is one-and-a-half million quid!

25
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,716
你愿不愿意施加一下影响?
So will you use that influence to help us?

26
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,966
这个...我是说抽象的影响
Well, when I said influence, I meant the indefinable sort,

27
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:24,365
无形的 潜在的优势
the intangible, subtle benefit

28
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:28,236
在大政方针的初级阶段
of an input into broad general policy at its early stages

29
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,166
朝有利选区的方向引导
while keeping constituency interests in mind.

30
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,283
就是不行?
Do you mean no?

31
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,839
这个...我大体愿意从根本上
Well, anything I can do in a broad,

32
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,885
以它为目标 我当然会...
general sense to further the cause, I will certainly...

33
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:41,486
出力
er, do.

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,597
如果我能的话 可是要一名大臣拨150万磅
If I can. But for a minister to pump one-and-a-half million

35
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,485
支援他选区的足球队
into his local football club!

36
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,245
他说不行
He means no.

37
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:53,884
能拉选票啊 争取年轻人 你会成为选区的英雄
But there'd be lots of votes in it. You'd be the hero.

38
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:58,285
"吉姆·哈克 阿斯顿队的救星" 终生保留议席
"The man who saved Aston Wanderers" Safe seat for life!

39
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:02,201
媒体会大做文章 反对党也会 法官也会
That might occur to the press. And the opposition. And the judge!

40
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:05,001
吉姆 这支队伍垮了 损失可惨重了
If this club goes to the wall It'll be a disaster.

41
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,441
看看我们的战绩
Look at our history!

42
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,196
英格兰足总杯 足联冠军 首次打入欧洲
FA Cup winners, League Champions, first team into Europe.

43
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,284
我都知道 哈里 可是话说回来
I know all that, but be fair.

44
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,280
这是地方事务 扯不上我们部
It's a local matter, not a ministerial one.

45
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,445
布赖恩 你是文艺休闲委员会主席 你没办法吗?
As chair of the Arts and Leisure Committee, can you help?

46
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:19,762
我? 别逗了
Me? You're joking.

47
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,237
我花了半年争取711磅
I spent half of yesterday trying to raise 711 quid

48
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,086
维修粮站美术馆的烟囱
to repoint the chimney on the art gallery.

49
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:29,484
那家破美术馆? 让它垮了得了
That miserable place? Why not let it fall down?

50
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:32,724
我倒没意见 不过万一砸到人 委员会要负责
I'd love to, but if it fell on somebody, the Council抯 liable.

51
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,400
那破地方归我们管
We own the bloody place!

52
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,246
不停有人出价要买
And we keep getting offers for the site.

53
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:40,399
上个月一家旧货市场刚找过我们
Save fair Supermarkets were after it last month.

54
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:43,246
等等 他们出多少?
Hold on, how much were they offering?

55
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,556
好像是200万磅
About two million quid, I think.

56
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:50,646
那你卖掉美术馆 球队就保住了
If you sold the art gallery, you could save the football club.

57
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:54,356
规划署要质询的     能看看美术馆吗?
There'd have to be a planning enquiry. Can we see it?

58
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,365
赶快去 他们5点下班
We'll have to be quick. They close at five.

59
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,602
还真破啊      2级保护建筑嘛
Hideous, isn't it? it抯 a Grade II listed building.

60
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,638
伯纳 我们的政治领袖大人
Bernard, what is our political master up to

61
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,446
对粮站美术馆打什么主意?
with the Corn Exchange Art Gallery

62
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:35,675
哦 您怎么知道?     反正不是听你说的 伯纳
Oh, how did you find out about that? Not from you, Bernard.

63
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:38,447
这个疏漏你要解释一下吗?
An omission you may care to explain.

64
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:43,077
这当然只是选区事务吧?     当然不是
Surely it抯 just a constituency matter? Surely not.

65
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:46,279
关闭美术馆 卖给旧货市场
Selling the gallery to Save fair Supermarkets

66
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,718
价款无息贷给阿斯顿足球队
and giving an interest-free loan to Aston Wanderers,

67
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,242
这是他作为议员而非大臣做的决定
he's acting as an MP not a minister.

68
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,403
这是原则问题 伯纳
It is the principle, Bernard.

69
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,997
你想不到后果会怎样吗?
Have you thought what the effect would be if this happens?

70
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,482
他会急速窜红     正是
He'd be very popular. Exactly!

71
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,718
红的发黑 红的可怕 然后呢?
Distressingly popular. Hideously popular. And then?

72
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:11,797
大臣下届会连任      这不是我们的首要目标
The minister would be re-elected. And that is not our top priority.

73
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:16,606
对我们部来说 谁当大臣无足轻重
in this department, it makes little difference who the minister is.

74
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:21,562
问题在于 要是别的球队也闹财政危机呢?
But the point is, suppose other football clubs got into difficulties?

75
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,644
赛犬会呢?
And what about greyhound racing?

76
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:27,322
补助了足球队 狗是不是也有份呢?
Should dog tracks be subsidised as well as football clubs?

77
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,486
人们想要的话 怎么不行?     伯纳
Why not, if that's what the people want? Bernard...

78
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,726
补助金...
subsidy...

79
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,362
是给艺术 给文化的
Is for art, for culture.

80
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,965
不是为了人们想要的东西
It is not to be given to what the people want!

81
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:48,117
是为了人们不想要 又非得有的东西
It is for what the people don抰 want but ought to have!

82
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,723
他们想要什么 自己会出钱的
If they want something they'll pay for it themselves!

83
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:59,036
不 我们补助的是教化 修养 精神文明提升
No, we subsidise education, enlightenment, spiritual uplift.

84
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,886
不是普通人的庸俗娱乐
Not the vulgar pastimes of ordinary people.

85
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:05,676
如此歪风 万不可长 必须制止
It's the thin end of the wedge. It must be stopped!

86
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:11,242
啊 大臣     汉弗莱 又怎么啦?
Ah, Minister. Humphrey. What's the matter now

87
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,041
大臣 预先提醒您一下
Minister, I thought you'd like early warning

88
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,562
内阁近期要重组
that there's a reshuffle in the offing.

89
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:23,525
该不是说...你不是...     不不 大臣
You don't mean... You're not suggesting... No, no, no, Minister.

90
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:27,197
这回是部门权责再分配
There is to be a departmental reorganisation.

91
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:29,637
是真的重组
A real reshuffle.

92
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,725
我们可能会增加职责呢      有好处么?
We may get extra responsibilities. Do we want them?

93
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,122
增加职责总是有好处的 大臣
We want all responsibilities, Minister,

94
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,801
如果同时增加人手和预算的话
If they mean extra staff and bigger budgets.

95
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,567
正是我们职责的广泛
It's the breadth of our responsibilities

96
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,639
让我们有分量 让您有分量 大臣
that makes us important, makes you important.

97
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,361
当您看到高楼大厦 人才济济
When you see vast buildings, huge staff

98
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,280
巨额预算 您看出什么?
and massive budgets, what do you conclude?

99
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,121
官僚主义?
Bureaucracy?

100
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:57,086
不 大臣 应该看到在这一切顶峰
No, Minister, you conclude that at the summit

101
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,404
高踞着一位伟大尊贵之人
there are men of great stature and dignity

102
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,001
君临天下 指点江山
who hold the world in their hands

103
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:05,482
所到之处莫不俯首称臣
and tread the earth like princes.

104
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,006
对 我能看到
Yes, I see.

105
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,838
所以新的职责要尽量攫取
So each new responsibility must be seized eagerly

106
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,481
而旧的职责要严加保卫
and each old one guarded jealously.

107
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,406
当然都是为您好 大臣
Entirely in your interests, of course, Minister.

108
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,523
是哦 谢谢你提醒我 汉弗莱
Thank you for warning me, Humphrey.

109
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,797
谢谢 大臣
Thank you, Minister.

110
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,085
哦 对了...
Oh! By the way...

111
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:31,363
关于粮站美术馆的提案
About the Corn Exchange Art Gallery proposal.

112
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,596
怎么?
What about it?

113
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:36,004
当然 那计划很有想象力 创意十足
It's the most imaginative scheme, novel idea,

114
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,165
但我觉得是否不大明智?
but I wonder if it might not be a little unwise?

115
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:40,316
为什么?
Why?

116
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,405
一座贵重的居民福利设施      一座怪物
A valuable civic amenity. A monstrosity!

117
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:47,115
一座贵重的居民福利怪物
A valuable civic monstrosity.

118
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,997
可它藏有一批英国美术珍品
An important collection of British paintings.

119
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,566
一点也不珍贵
Utterly unimportant.

120
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:56,396
18世纪二流肖像 19世纪三流风景画
Second-rate portraits, third-rate landscapes,

121
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,565
那些现代作品 泰特美术馆都不屑于收
modern paintings the Tate wouldn't even store.

122
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:03,646
可这是对非珍品的珍贵收藏
an important collection of unimportant paintings.

123
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:07,726
能大大提升过往居民的品味
And a source of great spiritual uplift to passing citizenry.

124
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,919
他们从不进去      可他们知道它在那
They never go in! But they know it抯 there.

125
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:14,676
馆长说平均每天只有11人参观
The curator says they average 11 visitors a day!

126
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:19,005
再说这是选区事务 无关政府 你操什么心?
It's a constituency matter. What's your interest?

127
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,596
这是原则问题     原则?
A question of principle. Principle?

128
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,765
您跟我说搞政治就是为了原则
What you used to tell me politics was about.

129
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,400
什么原则?
What principle?

130
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,240
从原则上允许剥夺艺术经费
The principle of taking money away from the arts

131
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,278
拿来支援足球这种东西
and putting it into football.

132
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,921
足球俱乐部属于商业机构
A football club Is a commercial operation.

133
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,204
就算它缺钱 也没理由发补贴
There's no cause for subsidy if it runs out of money.

134
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,806
怎么没有?     怎么没有?
Why not? Why not?

135
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:42,602
对啊 补贴艺术跟补贴足球都一样
Yes. There's no difference between subsidising football and art.

136
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,605
除了群众更喜欢足球一些
Except more people are interested in football.

137
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,367
我们的文化遗产必须保护
Our cultural heritage has to be preserved.

138
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,596
为了谁?
For whom?

139
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:54,085
为你们这些人 中产阶级知识分子
For people like you, you mean, the educated middle classes.

140
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:58,035
凭什么大家贴钱让少数中产阶级享乐?
Why should others subsidise the pleasures of the middle-class few

141
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,715
戏剧 歌剧 芭蕾
Theatre, opera, ballet!

142
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,283
补贴艺术是中产阶级劫贫济富之举
Subsidising art Is a middle-class rip-off.

143
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:07,245
大臣 您怎么能这么说?
Oh, Minister, how can you say such a thing?

144
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,005
补贴的目的在于教育
Subsidy is about education,

145
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,886
保护我们文明的精华
preserving the pinnacles of our civilisation.

146
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,361
您没发现吗?
Or hadn抰 you noticed?

147
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,121
不用你教我 汉弗莱 我也相信教育

很高兴知道伦敦政经学院也不完全反对教育
Glad to learn even the LSE Is not opposed to education.

150
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:30,083
补贴体育没什么不妥 体育也是教育
Nothing wrong with subsidising sport. Sport is educational.

151
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:33,563
我们还有性教育 性也要补贴吗?
We have sex education too. Should we subsidise sex?

152
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,086
可以吗?
Could we?

153
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:42,478
让我们根据公众需要来发补贴
Let us choose what we subsidise by the extent of popular demand.

154
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:46,646
这没有错 这是民主      可是大臣 这是导火索
It抯 democratic. it抯 the thin end of the wedge!

155
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,315
长此以往 皇家歌剧院
What would happen to the Royal Opera House,

156
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,047
我们文明的精粹会怎样呢?
the very summit of our cultural achievement?

157
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:55,205
很好 就说皇家歌剧院 他们演什么?
Very good case in point. What do they do?

158
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,597
莫扎特 瓦格纳 威尔第 普契尼
Mozart, Wagner, Verdi, Puccini.

159
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:01,077
德国和意大利文化 没我们什么事
Germans and Italians, not our culture.

160
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:06,125
何苦花钱补贴轴心国文化?
Why should we subsidise the culture of the Axis powers?

161
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:09,006
是我们的欧洲友邦 大臣
Our European partners, Minister!

162
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,119
皇家歌剧院有9500万磅
The Royal Opera House gets 9.5 million pounds

163
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,084
公共拨款 年年如此
of public money every year.

164
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:17,199
为了谁? 平民百姓买不起30磅的票
And for what? The public can't afford 30 seats

165
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,120
就算买得起 也买不到 票不够
and if it could there aren't enough of them.

166
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:24,445
观众大多是商业巨头
The audience consists of big business executives

167
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,996
团体包场的都是银行 石油公司
block-booked by the banks and oil companies

168
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,362
跨国公司 还有你这种人
and multinationals and people like you.

169
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,839
皇家歌剧院是精英阶层的乐园
The Royal Opera House Is the establishment at play.

170
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:35,766
凭什么让劳苦大众出钱供养
Why should the working man pay for the gentry

171
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,725
你们买得起票的绅士老爷?

172
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:43,205
大臣 我真的震惊了 这是野蛮 粗鄙
Minister, I'm quite frankly appalled. This is savagery, barbarism.

173
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:47,119
女皇的大臣居然说出这种话
That a Minister of the Crown should say such things,

174
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,881
简直...我们的文明算没救了
It's the end of civilisation as we know it,

175
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,362
并且完全扭曲事实真相
as well as being a gross distortion of the truth.

176
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:55,642
扭曲?
Distortion?

177
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,122

Did Shakespeare get a subsidy?

179
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,561
电影呢? 电影既是艺术也是教育
And films? Films are art and educational.

180
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,764
精英阶层怎么不补贴它?
Why does the establishment Ignore their subsidy?

181
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,435
因为你这种人偏爱歌剧
Because people like you prefer opera.

182
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,399
应该补贴电影这种
We should subsidise relevant art

183
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:13,320
群众喜闻乐见的艺术形式
like films that the man in the street can enjoy.

184
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,916
正是 他们是商业化的
Precisely! They are commercial.

185
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:19,443
抱歉失陪 我得先走了
Now, excuse me, I have to go early.

189
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,997
不行 我得赶紧换衣服
I can't. I have to dress.

190
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:35,006
换衣服? 你到底去哪?
Dress? Where are you gong?

191
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:42,596
既然您非要问 我去皇家歌剧院
Since you insist, I am gong to the Royal Opera House.

192
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,358
真的假的啊?
Are you really?

193
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,043
团体票对不对?
Gala night, is it?

194
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:55,244
没错 是您要问的     很多常任秘书都去吗?
Yes, it is, since you ask. Lots of Permanent Secretaries gong?

Some, no doubt.

196
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,960

205
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:35,202
最近大气候如何?     灰蒙蒙的是吗?
So, how's the environment? Bit smoky, isn抰 it?

206
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,996
你说我们部里啊 还是那么混乱
Oh, you mean my department? Chaos, as usual.

207
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:42,846
怎么 国务大臣想自己管事?
What, the Secretary of State Is trying to run it?

208
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,520
那我还能应付
I could cope with that.

209
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,685
有个新晋大臣在给他支招
One of the junior ministers Is trying to help him.

210
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,917
我的天 是谁?

00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,760
这次计划署质询
A planning enquiry.

214
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,202
一定要得出正确的结论
Important we get the right result.

215
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,524
你知道我的调查员都是独立的
My planning inspectors are absolutely independent.

216
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,036
那当然     不受外界压力
Absolutely. No undue influence.

217
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,839
不 我绝无此意
No, I wouldn't suggest it.

218
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:12,522
但是说到非正式指导方针...
But if it抯 a question of giving certain informal guidelines...

219
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:16,396
将调查置于正确角度      对 没错
Putting the enquiry into perspective. Yes, indeed.

220
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,643
对背景作出阐释 帮助人们
Explaining the background to facilitate

221
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:21,321
深刻理解事件状况及其后果

222
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,087
这就合情合理了     很好
That would be quite proper. Splendid.

223
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,596
非常感谢

要我堵什么漏子?

227
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,842
是关于西密德兰一家美术馆

230
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,642
那就好
Splendid.

231
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,805
保护建筑我们见一个拆一个
We're knocking them down all over the place.

232
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,965
不 不 必须驳回这个提案
No, no, the proposal has to be rejected.

233
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
是吗? 为什么?
Really? Why?

234
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,086
如果通过 他们会拿收益
If it goes through, they'll use the proceeds

235
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:05,284
去拯救当地濒临破产的足球队
to save the local football club from bankruptcy.

236
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,126
汉弗莱     我知道
Humphrey... I know.

237
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,322
一旦你从原则上允许
If once you allow the principle of money

238
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:14,877
把艺术的钱给普罗大众
being taken from the arts and given to ordinary people...

239
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:19,356
拿去寻开心
to enjoy themselves!

240
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,044
我同意     会落得什么下场啊?
I agree. Where will it end?

241
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,566
就是
Exactly.

242
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,637
谁出的馊主意?     我家主公
Where did this appalling idea come from? My lord and master.

243
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,078
他对那些大老粗的事最热心
He's getting very het up over the sweaty masses.

244
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,324
怎么没阻止他? 你干吗去了?
Didn抰 you stop him? What were you thinking of?

245
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:37,717
不关我事 是他的选区
It's not me. It's his constituency.

246
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:41,436
似乎他上周六向一群议员提出
Apparently he put it to a group of councillors last Saturday

247
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,165
他们欢呼雀跃
and they jumped at it.

248
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,677
我就说周末不能放他们出去乱跑
I've always said we shouldn't let him out at weekends!

249
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:50,676
净惹麻烦 你知道后果会怎样吧?
He only causes trouble. You realise where this could lead?

250
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:55,642
今天卖一座美术馆 救一支足球队
Today a gallery goes to support the local football club,

251
00:14:55,847 --> 00:15:00,045
明天就要拿皇家歌剧院基金去修温布利球场了
tomorrow the Opera grant goes to modernise Wembley

252
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:04,803
可不是 质询的事我就指望你了?
So I can trust you to keep an eye on the planning enquiry

253
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:08,204
这个 我不能影响调查员     当然不能
Well, I can't influence the inspector... 'Course not.

254
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,877
但我能找个早该升职的人负责
But I'll put someone on it who's overdue for promotion.

255
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,397
那好 你会跟他讲清楚吧?
Good. You'll give him a thorough briefing, won't you?

256
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,599
哦 我相信他能看到根本问题的
Oh, I'm sure he will see the real issue.

257
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,641
文明对抗野蛮
Civilisation versus barbarism.

258
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,199
我们不能拿艺术经费支援热门体育
We can't have arts money gong to popular sport.

259
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,961
这是纵容低级趣味
It's simply subsidising self-Indulgence.

260
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,646
正是
Exactly.

261
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:33,721
大臣 安排您今天的日程之前
Minister, before we go over today's diary,

262
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,402
容我大胆提个建议
there's something I'd like to suggest, if I may be so bold.

263
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:41,805
尽管大胆说      恕我直言 私以为
Be as bold as you like. Well, I feel, and I say this with respect,

264
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,596
您不该过多插手足球队的事
you shouldn't get too involved with this football club affair.

265
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,516
果然大胆啊 这是我的选区事务
That is bold, isn抰 it? It's a constituency matter.

266
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:53,845
我大胆总比您撞个头破血流好 大臣
Better for me to be "bold" than you to be stumped, Minister!

267
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,605
很好笑
Very droll.

268
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,646
政府中有条惯例 别说大臣 即使是议员
It's axiomatic in Whitehall that even an MP, let alone a minister,

269
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:04,686
也不能干涉自己选区的规划事宜
should never take part in planning his constituency.

270
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,765
为什么?    由于地区事务的微妙平衡
Why not? Because of finely-balanced local issues.

271
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,277
您讨好多少选民就得罪多少 横竖不划算
You'll offend as many constituents as you'll please.

272
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,923
扯上公营机构更是险上加险
It's especially dangerous if there's a quango in the wings.

273
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:19,006
不 这回没什么好平衡的 大家都一边倒
No. Issues aren't finely-balanced. Everyone's on the same side,

274
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,886
极个别多愁善感 高高在上的文艺分子除外
except a few wet, long-haired scruffy art lovers!

275
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,925
请看您今天上午的安排 大臣
We'll take a look at your diary for this morning.

Rural England? There's quite a lot of it out there!

282
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,440
这些人找我有什么事?
Why are all these people coming to see me?

283
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,279
美术馆的事 大臣
The art gallery, Minister.

284
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:54,206
这是文艺建筑帮的
It's the arts and architecture mafia.

285
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,563
11:45 民间手工与民俗理事会
11.45, the Country Crafts and Folklore Council.

286
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,876
这又是谁?
Who are they?

287
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,362
麻绳帮
The raffia mafia.

288
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:09,046
有名望的手艺人
Influential people coming out of the woodwork.

289
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:10,919
泰晤士报会刊登他们的信
There'll be letters in The Times,

290
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:14,204
周末版会撰文批判您破坏文物
hostile articles in the Sundays, you'll be called a vandal.

291
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:17,558
他们会组织您选区选民展开对抗
They'll orchestrate opposition in your constituency.

292
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,485
干吗排进我日程里?
Why did you put them in my diary

293
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,956
我又没要你安排 你想什么呢 伯纳?
I didn抰 ask you to. What were you thinking?

294
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:25,517
我想的是汉弗莱爵士 大臣 他让我安排的
I was thinking of Sir Humphrey. He asked me to.

295
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:29,117
不不 这条妙计我支持定了 尽管放马过来
I'm gong to support this excellent scheme, come what may.

296
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:34,166
随便您 大臣 能不能先请您过目
As you will. May I just have your approval for

297
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:37,285
这份地方政府津贴修正案?
this local government allowances amendment?

298
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:40,765
什么?      这是下院提交的法令草案
It's a statutory instrument to go before the House.

299
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,645
作为地方政府管理大臣
As Minister for Local Government,

300
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,321
您必须批准对1971年2号条例

第5条的修订于3月18日起生效

303
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,720
1954(乙)条例第7条

304
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,037
这都什么意思?
What the hell's all that mean?

305
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,442
里面有份摘要 大臣
There is an explanatory note.

306

316
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,279
"和经济损失补助最高限额"

317
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,121
我一点也没...     "1982年第7条例"
I haven't the faintest... "Regulation 7, 1982,

318
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,525

00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,718
"上述条例撤销了1972条例第7条"
by revoking regulation 7 of the 1972 regulations."

323
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,476
这是摘要吗?
That's an explanatory note?

324
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,596
是啊 我觉得很清楚
Yes, I think that's all quite clear.

325
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,685
为什么要我听这一团乱麻?
Why must I listen to this piddling gobbledegook?

326
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:19,286
抱歉大臣 我认为这个机会能确保
I thought it would be an opportune moment for you to ensure

327
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,842
在大臣您治理之下
that as a result of your ministerial efforts,

328
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,919
地方理事会成员能得到更多会议津贴
local councillors will get more for attending meetings.

329
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:28,005
哦 就是这个意思?     对
Oh, is that what it means? Yes.

330
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,239
好啊伯纳 你说得对 这是机会
Excellent. It is, as you say, opportune.

331
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,995
我能不能再提个小建议?
And may I make one further small suggestion?

332
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,395
随便提
Be my guest.

333
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:41,886
汉弗莱爵士昨晚会见了伊安惠沃爵士
Sir Humphrey had a word with Sir Ian Whitworth last night.

334
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:45,284
伊安惠沃     美术馆是登记在案的建筑
Ian Whitworth! The Corn Exchange is a listed building,

335
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:48,877
所以质询将由他手下一名调查员主持
so one of his planning inspectors will conduct the enquiry.

336
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:53,046
汉弗莱爵士和伊安爵士会给他非正式指导方针
Sir Humphrey and Sir Ian will give him some informal guidelines.

337
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:55,846
什么叫"非正式方针"?
How do you mean, "Informal guidelines"?

338
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:00,319
指导方针没什么不对 人人都有工作方针
Everyone has guidelines for their work.

339
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:04,044
规划调查员不是独立的吗?
I thought planning inspectors were impartial?

340
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,078
真的 大臣
Oh, really, Minister!

341
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,245
当然 火车也是独立的
So they are. Railway trains are impartial too.

342
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:13,838
只要铺好轨道 它们照样跟着走
But if you lay down the lines for them, that's the way they go!

343
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:17,638
可这不公平     这是政治 大臣
But that's not fair! it抯 politics, Minister.

344
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,486
汉弗莱爵士怎么搞起政治来了?
What has Sir Humphrey got to do with politics?

345
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,286
他是公务员 我负责政治
He's a civil servant. I'm the one in politics!

346
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,483
对 大臣 确实是您负责
Yes, Minister, indeed you are!

347
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:30,766
他们打算怎么对调查员施压?
How do they intend to put pressure on this planning inspector?

348
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:34,118
规划调查员有专门的等级制度
Planning inspectors have an independent hierarchy.

349
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:37,399
只要知道谁想升职就行
A vulnerable one Is one anxious for promotion.

350
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,723
怎么任命主持质询的调查员
How are planning inspectors chosen for an enquiry

351
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,798
大臣能干涉吗?
Could a minister interfere?

352
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:47,642
大臣都是我们的主公     很好
Ministers are our lords and masters. Good.

353
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,045
环保部政务次官
The Paril Sec at the Department of the Environment

354
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,084
是我的老朋友吉斯弗里曼
Is an old friend, Giles Freeman.

355
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,006
如果弗里曼先生能安排一名
Well, if Mr Freeman could arrange for an inspector

356
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,998
不在乎晋升的调查员
who didn抰 care about promotion,

357
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,675
比如说 找个快退休的
lf, for instance, he's about to retire,

358
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,082
他下结论时应该
he'll probably reach a verdict favouring

359
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,556
更为公众而非部门着想
the community rather than the department.

360
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:09,125
好 能帮我接吉斯的电话吗?
Good! Get me Giles on the phone, would you?

361
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,283
他的私人秘书说他今晚
His Private Secretary says he can meet you

362
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,961
投票之后在休息室等您
in the lobby after the vote this evening.

363
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:20,997
伯纳 你想过从政吗?
Bernard, have you ever thought of gong into politics?

364
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,237
我不想 大臣     为什么?
Oh, no, Minister. Why not?

365
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:28,883
我在我的字典里定义过政治     怎么定义的?
I once looked it up in my thesaurus. What did it say?

366
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,126
煽动 阴谋 操纵 推脱 贪赃枉法 蛊惑人心
Manipulation, intrigue, wire-pulling, evasion, graft, rabble-rousing...

367
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,285
还是留给诸位主公来操心好了
I'd prefer to leave that to our lords and masters.

368
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,047
我觉得我没有这些素质
I don't think I have the necessary qualities.

369
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,198
可别低估你自己 伯纳
Don't underestimate yourself, Bernard!

370
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:47,240
现在哈克拉拢到了吉斯弗里曼
Now it seems Hacker has got at Giles Freeman,

371
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,363
我们部的政务次官
the Parli Sec in my department,

372
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:53,765
他非要任命他的调查员 不要我那个
Appointing a different planning inspector to the one I chose

373
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,885
他的调查员赞成哈克的计划
One who'd be sympathetic to Hacker's scheme.

374
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:00,284
确实让人担心     担心? 这是死路一条
This is rather worrying. Worrying? it抯 desperate!

375
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,320
很可能这个规划调查员
There's now every danger that the planning inspector

376
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:05,364
会自己拿主意
could make up his own mind!

377
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,757
当地人会热烈欢迎这个计划
There's likely to be huge local support for the scheme.

378
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:12,919
我能帮什么忙?
But how can I help?

379
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:16,079
我指望你出主意呢 阿诺德
I hoped you'd have some ideas, Arnold.

380
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:20,645
等等 我想到了
Walt a minute! I've thought of something.

381
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:25,965
下周部门重组的时候
When the departmental reorganisation occurs next week...

382
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:32,604
你可以任命哈克为艺术总管大臣
you could make Hacker Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts!

383
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:36,723
他不是化外之民吗?     对
But isn抰 he a complete philistine? Yes.

384
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,566
反正工业部长也整天做无用功
But then the industry Secretary Is the idlest man in town.

385
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:48,767
教育部长没教养
The Education Secretary is illiterate!

386
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:54,125
就业部长该失业
The Employment Secretary Is unemployable!

387
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:58,085
这倒是 好主意 汉弗莱
Quite. That's good thinking, Humphrey.

388
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:02,041
哈克当了艺术总管大臣
Hacker can hardly start out as Cabinet Minister for the arts

389
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,243
不能首先就拆美术馆
by closing down an art gallery.

390
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:07,166
正是     但这不是内阁改组吧?
Exactly. But it抯 not a reshuffle, is it?

391
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,477
不 只是职能重新分配
No, I simply meant reorganise.

392
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:12,286
将艺术和广播电视
Move the arts and telecommunications

393
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:15,479
划入行政部管辖范围
into the purview of the DAA.

394
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:18,445
艺术和电视?
Arts and television together?

395
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,121
它俩有什么联系?
What have they got to do with each other?

396
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,517
死对头嘛
They're complete opposites.

397
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:27,400
不会造成一个霸王部门吧?
Wouldn抰 we be creating a monster department?

398
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:30,240
你们已经掌握地方政府了
You've already got local government as well.

399
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,240
艺术和地方政府天生一对
Arts and local government go well together.

400
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,442
怎么讲?
How so?

401
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,086
老乡骗老乡也是一门艺术
Well, the art of jiggery-pokery!

402
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:43,683
你确实是刚刚想到的吧?
You only just thought of this here and now, did you?

403
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:49,364
是啊 怎么?     你也是艺术家 对吗?
Yes, why? Bit of an artist yourself, aren't you?

404
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:51,839
哦 阿诺德
Oh, Arnold!

405
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:57,236
还有事吗 伯纳?     大臣 您会见足球队之前
Anything more, Bernard? Sir Humphrey wants a word

406
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:00,126
汉弗莱爵士有话要说
before your meeting about Aston Wanderers.

407
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:02,682
他不知道我不会动摇吗?
But I'm unshakeable on that!

408
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,117
没用的 汉弗莱 我决心已定
It's no good, Humphrey, my mind is made up.

409
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:09,366
尽管如此 大臣 内阁改组有新消息了
You might be interested in a new development

410
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:13,998
你说只是再分配的     不只是再分配
You said it was just a reorganisation. Not just a reorganisation.

411
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:16,238
而是再分配
A reorganisation.

412
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:20,960
我荣幸地宣布 它给我们部
I'm delighted to tell you that it has brought us,

413
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,402
给您增加了荣耀和分量
brought you, new honour and importance.

414
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:26,565
在现有的职责之上
In addition to existing responsibilities,

415
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:30,640
您又被任命为艺术总管大臣
you will be Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts.

416
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,682
是吗 这是好事啊
I say, that's rathergood, isn抰 it!

417
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:41,122
等等 你怎么比我还先知道?
Hold on, how do you know before I do?

418
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,887
内阁秘书作出决定之后
I just happened to be with the Cabinet Secretary

419
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,277
我刚好在他身边
shortly after the decision was taken.

420
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:47,886
这样啊
I see.

421
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:51,005
艺术总管大臣

大臣 我衷心希望您站在新角度

拯救一支足球队?     不不

428
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,278
不知道别人会怎么看
I was wondering how it would look

429
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:11,802
您作为艺术总管大臣
If as Minister responsible for the arts,

430
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,646
上任头一件事就拆美术馆
your first act was to knock down an art gallery.

431
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,076
那美术馆其实不错的...
It's quite a decent little art gallery...

432
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,844
就是     建筑挺有意思
Exactly. Interesting building.

433
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:40,005
2级保护建筑     大臣 您该开会了
Grade II listed. Minister, your meeting...

434
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,724

Oh, my God! What am I gong to say?

437
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,845
这是汉弗莱阿普比爵士 我的常任秘书
Sir Humphrey Appleby, my Permanent Secretary.

438
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,686
那他是临时秘书?
You mean he's only a temp!

439
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:04,564
形势一片大好 我们争取到了所有政党
It's gong great. We've got all the political parties with us

440
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:06,240
郡议会也支持
and the County Council.

441
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,756
只等你们部批准
All we need is your approval for using

442
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:12,078
把款项贷给足球队就行了
the sale of the art gallery as a loan to the club.

443
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:16,879
这个 恐怕有点问题
Well, I'm afraid there's a snag.

444
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,481
你说没问题的     呃 现在有了
You said there weren't any! Well, there is.

445
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,401
怎么?      问题在于...这个...
Well, it抯 just that... Well...

446
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:25,916
似乎...貌似...
It appears... Well, it seems...

447
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,965
应该说问题出现于...
Well, I should say it has emerged...

448
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:34,246
我想汉弗莱爵士比我清楚
Sir Humphrey can explain better than me.

449
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:44,085
做不到 先生们 那家美术馆是...合伙基金
It can't be done, gentlemen. Er, the art gallery is... it抯 a trust.

450
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:47,956
规定专款专用的      对 是合伙基金
Terms of the original bequest. Yes, it抯 a trust.

451
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:51,045
我们得拆别的建筑
We shall have to knock something else down!

452
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:55,405
学校 教堂 医院 肯定能腾出地来
School, church, hospital... There's bound to be something!

453
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:59,082
真不敢相信 你要我回去告诉大家
I can't believe this. So I have to tell people back home

454
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:01,238
说你出尔反尔?
you've gone back on your word?

455
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:04,245
是你自己的主意啊     不是我 是法律不允许
It was your own idea! it抯 not me, it抯 the law.

456
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:07,245
你早干吗去了 现在才发现?
Why didn抰 you find out till now

457
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,204
这个...
Well...

458
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,005
那我挑明了告诉你
Let me be absolutely frank with you.

459
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:29,079
实际上 这事有可能 仅仅是可能成功
It would be possible to push this through

460
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:33,246
不过要拖很久     拖呗 已经这么久了
but it would take an awful long time. Ok, we've spent enough.

461
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:37,798
问题在于 这就要放弃另一件事
Trouble is, something else would have to go by the board.

462
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,475
我手头正忙着的事
The thing that's taking my time at the moment

463
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:43,445
是要争取增加地方议员经费
Is forcing through councillors' expenses

464
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:46,167
和会议津贴
and attendance allowances.

465
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,876
我不能同时对两边施压
I can't put my personal weight behind both schemes.

466
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:57,962
那就放弃地方议员涨津贴的事
Forget about the increased allowances for councillors

467
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:02,285
专心解决卖美术馆的法律问题
and concentrate on the legal obstacles, the sale of the art gallery.

468
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:07,965
法律问题很难搞的      这回尤其难搞
Tricky things, legal obstacles. This is a particularly tricky one.

469
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,687
就算费尽心思 最后还可能功亏一篑
At the end of the day, you might still fall.

470
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:16,196
都没准的     如果这样的话...
Every possibility. If that's the way it is...

471
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:18,841
我们有可能计划
there's a chance we might want to close

472
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,680
年末关闭爱丁山小学
Edgehill primary at the end of the year...

473
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:25,243
那块地也能卖个一两百万
That site would fetch a couple of million, give or take.

474
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:29,201
好吧 就这么办 不会跟你过不去
Well, there it is, then. No ill feelings to you.

475
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,238
好的 那你回地方上解释
Good. And you'll explain locally

476
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,967
我们绕不过法律规定?
that we can't overcome the legal obstacles?

477
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,477
尽管放心 继续努力吧
'Course we will. Carry on with the good work!

478
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:46,516
大臣 您真是艺术家
Oh, Minister, a work of art.

479
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:54,202
恕我失陪 我要去换衣服了    又是工作聚会?
If you'll excuse me, I have to dress. Another works' outing?

480
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,646
呃 汉弗莱     大臣?
Er, Humphrey... Minister?

481
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,846
作为艺术总管大臣
As Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts...

482
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,200
我能一起去吗?
could I come too?

483
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,606
是 大臣
Yes, Minister!
