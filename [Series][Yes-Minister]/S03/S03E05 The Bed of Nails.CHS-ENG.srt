4
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:42,173
如坐针毡

5
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,557
你确定哈克是最佳人选吗?
Are you sure Hacker's the man for this?

6
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:47,443
是的
Yes.

7
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:51,805
他是制定国民综合交通政策的最佳人选?
He's the best choice to bring in an integrated transport policy?

8
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,435
是的      但他根本不懂交通
Yes. But he knows nothing about it!

9
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:55,842
没错
No.

10
00:00:57,527 --> 00:01:00,087
你问过交通部长了吗?
You've sounded out the Transport Secretary

11
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,760
他坚决不干
He won't touch it.

12
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,283
确实 如坐针毡啊
Yes. This could turn out to be a bed of nails.

13
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:06,880
是顶荆冠
A crown of thorns.

14
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:08,241
是个圈套
A booby trap.

15
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:12,036
而且 还得看起来会有成就
It has to look like something抯 gong to be done.

16
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:15,765
需要一系列特殊才干
It calls for a particular combination of talents,

17
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,395
专搞徒劳无功这一套
lots of activity but no actual achievement.

18
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,120
我懂了
I see.

19
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,676
那就非哈克莫属了
Then Hacker is the man!

20
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,118
那我们怎么劝他?
So how do we go about him?

21
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,836
你是首相的首席特别顾问 你知道规则
You're the PM's Chief Special Advisor. You know the form.

22
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,396
把它弄成特殊荣誉
We make it seem like a special honour.

23
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,000
一个晋升 一份礼物
A promotion. A present.

24
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:38,477
但汉弗莱爵士会警告哈克万万接不得
But Sir Humphrey will tell Hacker he'd be crazy to do it.

25
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:41,764
是啊 "Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes"
Yes. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,

26
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,599
我知道他要说什么
I can hear him say.

27
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:47,282
可以译为 "小心希腊人的糖衣炮弹"
"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts," roughly translated.

28
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:50,678
汉弗莱还得给哈克译成英文
Humphrey would have put it in English for Hacker's benefit.

29
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:52,963
哈克上的伦敦政治经济学院
Hacker went to the LSE.

30
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,963
我也是      哦 我很抱歉
So did I. Oh, I am sorry.

31
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:02,240
我们必须立刻委任哈克
We must get an immediate commitment from Hacker

32
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,159
不给他机会通知汉弗莱
before he talks to Humphrey.

33
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:07,842
今天? 现在?      你觉得不管用?
Today? Now Don't you think it抣l work?

34
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,646
奉承一个政客? 几时失败过?
Flattering a politician? When's it ever failed?

35
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:16,165
我们叫它"交通总管" 怎样?
We'll offer to call him Transport Supremo, shall we?

36
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:20,161
不错 比交通冤大头好听多了
Yes, much more attractive than Transport Muggins!

37
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,687
啊 吉姆
Ah, Jim!

38
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,280
你好 马克
Hello, Mark.

39
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,157
阿诺德      喝点什么?
Arnold. Drink?

40
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,238
好的 谢谢
Yes, thank you.

41
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,682
一切都顺利吧?      很不错
Everything all right? Everything抯 fine.

42
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:43,882
我们想...
We wanted...

43
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,607
呃 是首相希望
That is, the Prime Minister wanted

44
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,917
内阁秘书和我
the Cabinet Secretary and me

45
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,396
问你点事...
to sound you out about something...

46
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,604
很大的荣誉 告诉你
something of an honour, I may say.

47
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:58,555
荣誉? 不是要...把我踢到上院去吧?
Honour? You don't mean kicked up there?

48
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,116
不 是真正的荣誉
No, no. A real honour.

49
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,279
要增加很大责任
A significant increase of responsibility.

50
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,039
请问 你怎么看
Now, what are your views

51
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,199
国民综合交通政策?
on the integrated National Transport Policy?

52
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:11,403
我...
Er... I... I...

53
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,122
那个 我...
Well, er... I...

54
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,600
请继续
Go on.

55
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:22,162
首相认为我们急需综合交通政策
The PM has decided we need a national transport policy.

56
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,046
是啊 为什么不呢?
Yes. Well. Why not?

57
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,958
你赞成?
You're in favour?

58
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:39,438
不幸的是 公众对国民交通业的不满
Public dissatisfaction with the nationalised transport industries

59
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:43,919
已经高调到使政府为难了 你知道的
Is now to worry the government, as you know.

60
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,919
请继续?
Can you go on?

61
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:53,524
不 继续不下去了      不 需要有个政策
No, we can't go on, not like this. We need a policy.

62
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:56,724
不能年年秋冬季骂管理层
Not just blame the management if there's an R in the month

63
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,878
春夏骂工会
and the unions the rest of the time.

64
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,038
不幸的是 它们汇到一起了
Unfortunately, they've got together.

65
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,562
现在一年四季都骂政府
Their line is It's the government's fault.

66
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:08,005
这种混乱都源于缺少综合政策
Everything wrong is not having an integrated policy.

67
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:11,443
我们提过政策啊      有吗?
We did have a policy before. Did we?

68
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:14,599
是啊 我们的政策就是没有政策
Yes, it was our policy not to have a policy.

69
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:18,997
但现在首相想要个积极政策
Well, now the PM wants a positive policy.

70
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,079
哦 首相 是啊
Oh, the PM. Yes, well, er...

71
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,364
我完全同意 我一贯这么认为
I couldn't agree more. I've always thought so.

72
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:26,516
很好
Good.

73
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:29,281
可这是交通部的事吧?
Surely it抯 a Ministry of Transport matter?

74
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:30,800
不
No.

75
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:34,039
交通部长当然很想插手
Obviously the Transport Secretary would love the job,

76
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,959
但他太贴近这行了
but he's too close to it all.

77
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:40,006
当局者迷      需要一个开明崭新的头脑
It needs an open mind, uncluttered.

78
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:45,002
所以 首相决定委任一名总管
So the PM has decided to appoint a supremo

79
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:49,080
来制订和执行国民综合交通政策
to develop and implement a national transport policy.

80
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,205
总管?     总管
Supremo? A supremo.

81
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,766
就是...
And...

82
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,645
完全正确
Exactly.

83
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,720
我们一致认为你最开明
It was agreed you had the most open mind.

84
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,605
并且毫无成见
And the most uncluttered.

85
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:08,406
当然 这也是很大的荣誉和责任
Of course it抯 a great honour and a responsibility.

86
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:13,766
可有什么 什么样的...我是说...
Er, but what... What sort of... Er... I mean...

87
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:18,000
你想问综合交通政策有何要求 是吗大臣?
what is required of an transport policy minister?

88
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,240
旨在帮助消费者      也很受公众拥戴
it抯 to help the consumer. Very popular with the public.

89
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,195
不是说它...      当然不 这是我的职责
Not that that would... No, of course not. it抯 my duty.

90
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:30,326
比如 高速公路的规划没顾及铁路
The motorways were planned without reference to the railways,

91
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,682
所以很多公路
so there are great stretches of motorway

92
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,315
跟已有铁路线并行
running alongside already existing railways.

93
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:39,719
而有些地区两样都没有      对 就知道你明白
While other areas aren't served at all. Quite.

94
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:42,799
还真挺简单的      是啊
it抯 really quite simple. Yes.

95
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,846
还有联运客票的问题      联运客票?
Then there's through tickets. Through tickets?

96
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,039
如果你想在亨里和伦敦间往返
If you want to commute from Henley to the City,

97
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,846
得买张火车票到帕丁顿
you need one British Rail ticket to Paddington

98
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,521
再买张地铁票到银行
and then an Underground ticket to the Bank.

99
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,086
你有没有见过
Have you ever seen

100
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,205
公交铁路综合时刻表?
a combined bus and railway timetable?

101
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,325
或铁路站台上的公交时刻表?
Or ever seen a bus timetable in a railway station?

102
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,445
公交车司机见过公交时刻表么?
Has a bus driver ever seen a bus timetable?

103
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,995
有条铁路西线 经过
There's a British Rail Western Region line

104
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,727
希思罗机场以北不到一里
running less than a mile north of Heathrow,

105
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,718
但却没有连通
but no link line.

106
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:20,004
整个伦敦 公交和铁路都没有整合
Bus and train services don't connect, all over London.

107
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,965
伦敦以外也是一样
And outside London there are problems.

108
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,039
可能吧 但我们不关心
Probably. But we don't know about them.

109
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,085
是啊 有很多余地啊
It's full of possibilities.

110
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:32,876
能让我先和汉弗莱商量一下吗?
You'd like me to discuss it with Humphrey and come back?

111
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:36,005
确实应该和汉弗莱爵士商量
There is much to discuss with Sir Humphrey,

112
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:39,443
但我们希望你马上表态
but we need an indication of your response now.

113
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,679
首相30分钟内就要去机场
The PM's car leaves for the airport in 30 minutes.

114
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,166
参加渥太华会议
The Ottawa conference.

115
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,876
还有纽约联合国总部演说      华盛顿会议
Then the UN speech in New York. Then Washington.

116
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:52,518
天 真是长途 谁来管这个国家呢?
Gosh, what a long trip. Who's gong to run the country

117
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,996
对不起 阿诺德 我真蠢
Sorry, Arnold. Silly question.

118
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:59,926
那我们给首相报喜了?      很多事要着手了
So we can give the PM the good news? There's a lot to put in hand.

119
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,797
好的 我接受      了不起 再来一杯吧
Oh, yes. I'm on. Splendid! Have another drink.

120
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:10,086
啊 大臣      抱歉我迟到了
Ah, Minister. Sorry I'm late.

121
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:13,319
我有个振奋人心的好消息      是什么 大臣?
Got some splendid news. Indeed, Minister?

122
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:17,036
我得到份新工作      本部门对失去您十分惋惜
I have a new job. The department will be sorry to lose you.

123
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:20,316
不 我是说额外工作
No, I mean an extra job.

124
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,920
要我制订
I've been asked to develop

125
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,636
国民综合交通政策 首相指派的
an integrated national transport policy by the Prime Minister.

126
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:28,526
知道了 那好消息是?
I see. And what was the good news?

127
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,240
这就是好消息啊
That was the good news.

128
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:37,082
哦 请原谅我冒失的提问
Oh. Then how, if I may be so bold as to enquire,

129
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,522
您如何定义坏消息?      什么?
would you describe bad news? What?

130
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,202
大臣 您知道接受这工作 后果会如何吗?
Do you realise what this job would mean if you accept it?

131
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,403
我已经接受了      您说什么?
I have accepted it. You've what?

132
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:51,401
我已经接受了      大臣 您开玩笑吧
I have accepted it. Minister, you're not serious!

133
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,320
对 这是荣誉 我们也确实需要交通政策
Yes, it抯 an honour. We need a transport policy.

134
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:57,081
如果您的"我们"是指英国 的确如此
If by 搘e?you mean Britain, that's quite true.

135
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,556
但如果"我们"是指我们部
But if by 搘e?you mean this department,

136
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:04,005
制订交通政策就像在我们颅骨上钻洞
we need a transport policy like an aperture in the cranial cavity!

137
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,599
吃力不讨好的事
It is a bed of nails!

138
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,600
我知道会有额外的行政工作 汉弗莱
I know it may cause extra administrative duties.

139
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,678
大臣 这不是重点
Minister, that is not the point.

140
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,919
之所以没有综合交通政策 是因为
The reason there's no integrated transport policy

141
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:19,160
它会有益于所有人 只除了制订它的大臣
In everybody's interest except the minister

142
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:20,396
为什么?
Why?

143
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:25,605
我怎样解释您好懂呢?
How can I put it in a manner which is close to your heart?

144
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:30,443
这是选票杀手      选票杀手?
It is the ultimate vote loser. Vote loser?

145
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,917
您觉得为什么交通部长不自己干?
Why do you think the Transport Secretary isn抰 doling it?

146
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,476
他为何推荐掌玺大臣?
Why did he suggest the Lord Privy Seal?

147
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,603
为什么掌玺大臣又推荐
Why did the Lord Privy Seal suggest

148
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,076
兰开斯特公爵郡大臣
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,

149
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,124
他又为何推荐枢密院长?
who suggested the President of the Council?

150
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,686
我没听说啊
I didn抰 know this.

151
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,601
为什么他们请您去10号 要瞒着我呢?
And why did they invite you to No. 10 behind my back?

152
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:52,999
大臣 这一苦差在整个白厅
This hideous appointment has been hurtling round Whitehall

153
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,796
被踢来踢去三个星期 完全是颗未爆弹
for three weeks like a grenade with the pin taken out!

154
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,795
如果被我拿下 我会荣耀加身
If I pull it off, It'll be a feather in my cap.

155
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,846
如果您拿下来 大臣 就加不了身了
If you pull it off, Minister, It won抰 be in your cap any more.

156
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,042
谢谢 伯纳
Thank you, Bernard.

157
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:09,882
如果您真的拿下 十年内不会有人受益
If you pull it off, no one will feel the benefits for ten years.

158
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:12,686
远在那之前 您和我就不在职了
Long before that, you and I will have moved on.

159
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,116
升职了
Or up.

160
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,278
更可能离职了      离职?
Or out. Out?

161
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:20,156
眼下 制订政策意味着做决策
In the meantime, formulating policy means making choices.

162
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,524
而做决策 只会取悦受惠的人
Once you do that, you please the people that you favour,

163
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,405
但激怒其他所有人
but infuriate everybody else.

164
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:28,081
赢得一票 就丢掉十票
One vote gained, ten lost.

165
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,681
如果您把一份工作给公路局
If you give the job to the road services,

166
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,122
铁路局和工会都要抗议
the rail board and unions will scream.

167
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,518
给铁路局 公路局会把您大卸八块
Give it to the railways, the road lobby will massacre you.

168
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:38,678
削减英航的投资计划
Cut British Airways Investment plans,

169
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:42,044
他们当天下午就会召开记者会
they'll hold a devastating press conference that same day.

170
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,437
但我会成为交通总管啊
But I'm gong to be Transport Supremo!

171
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,760
似乎公务员术语是交通冤大头
I believe the Civil Service vernacular Is Transport Muggins!

172
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:54,001
不 汉弗莱 是首相让我
No, the Prime Minister has asked me

173
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,398
接受这份工作 担起责任
to undertake this task, this necessary duty.

174
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,957
无论如何 我们都要尽职尽责
After all, we must all endeavour to do our duty.

175
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:04,843
而且 马克爵士认为会招揽选票
Furthermore, Sir Mark thinks there may be votes in it.

176
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,521
好东西我不会挑嘴的
I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.

177
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:10,639
大臣 您挑的是特洛伊木马的嘴
You're looking a Trojan horse in the mouth!

178
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:14,756
如果仔细看这马 会看见特洛伊人吗?
If we look closely at this gift horse we'll find it full of Trojans?

179
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,646
如果朝特洛伊木马嘴里看 大臣
If you'd looked a Trojan horse in the mouth,

180
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,957
里面会是希腊人
you'd have found Greeks inside.

181
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,963
是希腊人送特洛伊木马给特洛伊人的
It was the Greeks who gave the Trojan horse to the Trojans.

182
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,563
理论上这不是特洛伊木马 是希腊木马
Technically, it wasn抰 a Trojan horse but a Greek horse.

183
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,161
因此 名言"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes"
Hence the tag Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,

184
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,442
您记得的
which, you'll recall,

185
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:34,280
经常会错误的翻译成
Is usually and somewhat Inaccurately translated,

186
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,119
"小心希腊人的糖衣炮弹"
"Beware Greeks bearing gifts,"

187
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:40,166
如果您没上伦敦政经大学 您一定记得
or you would recalled had you not attended the LSE.

188
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,362
希腊谚语很好 但我们能否不要跑题?
Greek tags are all very well, but can we stick to the point?

189
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,677
对      抱歉 希腊谚语?
Yes... Sorry, Greek tags?

190
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,202
"小心希腊人的糖衣炮弹"
"Beware Greeks bearing gifts."

191
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,164
欧共体一定会说成
The EEC equivalent would be,

192
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:55,319
"小心希腊人的橄榄油炮弹"
"Beware Greeks bearing an olive oil surplus"!

193
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,524
绝妙      不 大臣 关键问题是
Excellent. No, the point is, Minister,

194
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,439
正如特洛伊木马来自希腊
just as the Trojan horse was Greek,

195
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,996
您说的希腊谚语 其实源自拉丁
what you call a Greek tag Is, in fact, Latin.

196
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,204
显然 希腊人绝对不会提防自己人
The Greeks wouldn't suggest bewaring of themselves,

197
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,403
如果可以用这样的分词
if one can use such a participle,

198
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,525
之所以是拉丁 不仅因为"Timeo"以"o"结尾
and it抯 clearly Latin not because "Timeo" ends in "o",

199
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,076
希腊语第一人称也以"o"结尾
as the Greek first person also ends in "o".

200
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:18,479
尽管希腊语里有"Timao"这个词 意为"我荣幸"
No, there is a Greek word "Timao" meaning "I honour",

201
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,286
但"os"是一个单数主格词尾
but the "os" ending is a nominative singular termination

202
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,201
希腊语第二变位 拉丁语中则是宾格复数
of a second declension in Greek and an accusative plural in Latin,

203
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,916
尽管Danaos不仅是希腊语中的"希腊"
though actually Danaos Is not only the Greek for Greek,

204
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:31,123
也是拉丁语中的"希腊" 挺有意思的
It's also the Latin for Greek.

205
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:37,365
我明白了 汉弗莱 但真那么糟糕吗?
Yes, I take your point, Humphrey, but is it really as bad as that?

206
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,404
大臣 也许...
Minister, perhaps...

207
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,320
也许我该为您证明一下
Perhaps you will allow me to prove it to you.

208
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:46,598
我会安排一次预备会议
I will arrange a preliminary conference for you

209
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:50,680
召集三位副秘书 分别来自交通部的
with three Under-Secretaries from the Department of Transport,

210
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,725
公路 铁路和航空部门
from the roads, rail and air transport divisions.

211
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,115
公务员? 这能证明什么?
What will that prove?

212
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:58,245
会列举一些您将面临的问题
It may illustrate some problems you will encounter.

213
00:11:58,407 --> 00:11:59,886
也许你是对的 汉弗莱
You may be right.

214
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:04,279
但如果我成功了 这将成为我的马岛大捷
But if I succeed, this could be my Falkland Islands.

215
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,880
对
Yes.

216
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,115
您会成为加尔铁里将军
And you could be General Galtieri!

217
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,558
无意冒犯 大臣 我不得不指出
With respect, I feel constrained to point out

218
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,604
这个议案原则不对
the proposal is deeply misguided.

219
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:21,806
哦 你的意见是?      我建议 政府应该
So what do you suggest? It should be government policy

220
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:26,040
把公路作为货运的重点手段
to designate road haulage as freight transport.

221
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,675
抱歉打断一下 大臣
If I might crave your indulgence for a moment,

222
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:32,476
我认为这种政策 坦率地说
I think such a policy would be, not to put too fine a point on it,

223
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,205
太目光短浅了
unacceptably short-sighted.

224
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,245
铁路才是最佳运输手段
Rail transport must surely be the favoured carrier

225
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,159
健全的政府都会这么想
under any sane national policy.

226
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:41,124
恕我直言
With the greatest respect,

227
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,677
二位的议案都会酿成大祸
both those proposals are formulae for disaster.

228
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,442
从长远考虑 应加强空运建设
Long-term considerations mandate the increase of airfreight.

229
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,599
如果大臣希望预算大规模上升...
If the minister wants a massive budget increase...

230
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:55,157
如果大臣接受长期而坚决的铁路大罢工...
If the minister accepts a long, bitter rail strike...

231
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:59,445
如果大臣能容忍公众不满情绪突然上涨...
If the minister can tolerate a massive rise in public discontent...

232
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,646
等一下
Hold on!

233
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:05,402
我们代表政府 不是吗?      您当然是 大臣
We are the government, aren抰 we? Indeed you are, Minister.

234
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:09,003
所以我们利益一致      当然 毫无疑问
So we're all on the same side. Indeed, no question.

235
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,998
都为了国家好
Doling what's best for Britain.

236
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,637
难道毁灭航空业是为国家好?
Is the end of the airfreight business best for Britain?

237
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,436
国家怎能承受铁路四分五裂?
How is Britain served by the destruction of the railways?

238
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:22,441
显然 公路衰退又怎会有益于国家呢?
How does Britain benefit from a deterioration of the road network?

239
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:27,203
我是要整个政府的货运政策
I want options for the government's freight transport

240
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,517
我以为这个预备会议
I thought a preliminary discussion,

241
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:33,600
是老朋友围在一起 提些积极意见...
a few friends around the table, a few positive suggestions...

242
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:38,124
当然 扩充铁路系统...      壮大高速公路...
An expansion of rail... expansion of motorway...

243
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:42,997
提高空运能力...      我只想缩减预算
An expansion of airfreight. I need a reduction in costs.

244
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,125
如此一来 就只有一个办法
Then there is only one possible course.

245
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:47,515
的确如此
Indeed there is.

246
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,996
至于是什么也毋庸置疑
And there's no doubt what it is.

247
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,241
好极了 我喜欢最终达成共识
I always like to end on a note of agreement.

248
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:54,760
谢谢各位
Thank you, gentlemen.

249
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,406
大臣
Minister.

250
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:01,083
得安排下次会议时间 这边请
Perhaps we could discuss a date for our next meeting.

251
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,320
真是个直率的会议
That was a very frank meeting.

252
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,877
比直率更甚 大臣 简直刀光剑影了
More than frank, Minister. Frank bordering on direct.

253
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,481
没事 明早清洁工会把血迹擦掉的
The cleaners will mop up the blood tomorrow.

254
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,400
伯纳 能帮帮我吗?
Bernard, can you help me?

255
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,559
怎么帮 大臣?      副秘书也是公务员吧
How, Minister? Under-Secretaries are civil servants.

256
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,878
但他们却像律师 像公交利益集团雇来
But they behave like counsel briefed by the transport interests

257
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,366
打击政府的
to defeat the government.

258
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,121
很对 大臣      不 伯纳 这不对
That's right. No, Bernard, that's wrong.

259
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:25,436
但公务员原理如此
That's how it works.

260
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:29,839
一个部门管着谁 就由谁说了算
Controlled by the people it抯 supposed to control.

261
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,122
怎么讲?
How do you mean?

262
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,279
我们为何实行素质教育?
Why do we have comprehensive education?

263
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,280
谁乐意? 学生还是家长?      都不是
Who wanted it? Pupils, parents? Not really.

264
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,642
是全国教师协会
The National Union of Teachers,

265
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:42,321
它们是教育部的最大客户
the chief client of the Department of Education,

266
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,079
于是教育部就实施素质教育
so the DES went comprehensive.

267
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,363
您看 各部门都服务于
Departments act for the powerful interest

268
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,916
和它有永久关系的集团
with whom they have a permanent relationship.

269
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,238
就业部服务于劳工联合会
The Department of Employment lobbies for the TUC.

270
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:56,400
工业部服务于雇主 很完美的平衡
The Department of Industry lobbies for the employers.

271
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,205
能源部服务于石油公司
Energy lobbies for oil companies,

272
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,677
国防部为军队 内务部为警察
Defence for the armed forces, the Home Office for the police.

273
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:05,760
整个系统都在阻止内阁提出政策?
So the system alms to stop the Cabinet carrying out its policies?

274
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,157
总有人负责这个
Well, somebody's got to!

275
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,517
所以出台国民交通政策
So formulating a national transport policy

276
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,599
不仅要对抗交通行业
means fighting not just the transport industry

277
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:18,839
还有所有公务员?
but the entire Civil Servlce as well?

278
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:23,435
公务员不是该帮助政府施政吗?
Shouldn't the Civil Servlce help the government?

279
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:27,486
这个 只有当政策可行的时候
Well, as long as the government's wishes are practicable.

280
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:28,682
什么意思?
Meaning?

281
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,407
只有公务员认可的时候
As long as the Civil Servlce agrees with them!

282
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,757
有建树的会议 大臣
Useful meeting, Minister.

283
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,399
好吧 汉弗莱
All right, Humphrey.

284
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:39,682
你赢了
You win.

285
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:45,563
我赢了什么?      我们得赶紧脱身
What do I win? We must get out of our commitments.

286
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,356
很明显 交通总管头衔还是不要的好
Clearly the title Transport Supremo Is not worth having.

287
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:52,121
我们得让首相改变主意
We must change the Prime Minister's mind.

288
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,606
您的"我们"是复数
Is that "we" plural,

289
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,396
还是单指总管大人一人?
or do supremos now use the royal pronoun?

290
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,919
我说咱们俩 汉弗莱
I mean both of us, Humphrey,

291
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,282
除非你想行政部来负责
unless you want the DAA saddled with this.

292
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,199
那您的意思是?
So, what are you suggesting?

293
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:09,042
伯纳 能找到首相选区的地图吗
Bernard, find a map of the PM's constituency.

294
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:12,199
汉弗莱 我需要些建议      什么 大臣?
Humphrey, I need some advice. Yes, Minister?

295
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,757
你觉得一项国民交通政策
Could the formulation of a national transport policy

296
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,236
会不会被当地所反对?
have unwanted local repercussions?

297
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:22,200
会的 当然 大臣
Er, yes, indeed, Minister.

298
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,483
就算这选区的代表
Even in a constituency represented

299
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,081
是政府高级领导人
by a very senior member of the government,

300
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:30,080
实际上 是最高领导人?
the most senior member of the government?

301
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:31,600
真难堪 太难堪了
Deeply embarrassing!

302
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,077
大臣 这是街道图和指南
Here's the street map and the directory.

303
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,316
好极了 伯纳
Splendid.

304
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:39,320
这是首相的选区 是吧?
This is the Prime Minister's constituency, isn抰 it?

305
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,125
看 一个公园
Oh, look, a park!

306
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,877
挨着火车站
Near the station.

307
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,515
大臣 交通政策要件之一
One requirement of a transport policy

308
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:52,441
就是让公交站靠近火车站
Is to bring bus stations nearer to railway stations.

309
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,643
那就得建在公园里
But that would mean building on the park.

310
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,876
唉 是的
Alas, yes.

311
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:59,401
总得有人为国家利益做出牺牲
Somebody has to suffer in the national interest.

312
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,920
记下来 伯纳
Take a note, Bernard.

313
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,636
公交车站搬进夏洛特公园
Bus station to be moved into Queen Charlotte's Park.

314
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:08,643
大臣 这儿有个大型公交维修站
Oh, Minister, there's a big bus repair shop.

315
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:12,356
把公交和铁路维修站合并会更划算吧?
Isn't it economic to amalgamate the bus and train repairs?

316
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:14,119
当然 省不少钱呢
Absolutely. Big saving.

317
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:17,040
关闭公交维修站 伯纳
Bus repair shop to be closed, Bernard.

318
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:20,324
这是个通勤的国家 该怎么办?
This is commuter country, what about that?

319
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,682
通勤列车常年亏损
Commuter trains run at a loss.

320
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,077
只有上下班高峰期有人坐
They're only really used at rush hours.

321
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,966
所以通勤人员 实际上受了国家补助
So commuters are, in effect, subsidised.

322
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:32,200
这对别的人不公平吧?      令人发指 大臣
Isn't that unfair on the others? it抯 a great injustice.

323
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,564
通勤全部自费 伯纳
Commuters to pay full economic fares, Bernard.

324
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:38,596
当心 票价会翻一番
Mind, that'll double the price of tickets.

325
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,440
舍不得孩子套不着狼嘛
Can't make an omelette without breaking eggs!

326
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:44,440
这里火车站挺多的
There are quite a few railway stations in this area.

327
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,280
铁路和地铁都有      怎么?
British Rail and Underground. Yes?

328
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:51,636
有人说有夜间铁路服务的地区
One view is that areas with reasonable rail services

329
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,685
就不需要夜班公交了
don't need an evening bus servlce too.

330
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,122
言之有理 正合我意
Avery persuasive view, to my mind.

331
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,881
所有公交下午6点半收班
All bus services to cease after6.30pm.

332
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:03,281
那这块地方
What about this space

333
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,961
公交站原址怎么办?
when the bus station抯 moved to the park?

334
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:11,042
大臣 这个地区很缺集装箱卡车停车场
Well, the area's very short of parking space for container lorries...

335
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,119
尤其是晚上
especially at night.

336
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:18,316
公交站原址建集装箱卡车停车场 伯纳
Container lorry park on bus station site, Bernard.

337
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,524
进出道路要扩宽吧?
Won't that mean widening this access road?

338
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:22,802
没错
Yes, indeed.

339
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,403
室内游泳池西翼要拆掉了
We'll have to take away the western half of the swimming baths.

340
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,364
恐怕是这样
I'm afraid so.

341
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:32,679
当然 这就是一国之策对当地的影响
These are just the local implications of a broad national policy.

342
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,565
一点不错 大臣
Exactly, Minister.

343
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:38,402
不过 我还是该向首相打份私人报告
Even so, I ought to write a paper to the Prime Minister personally.

344
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,604
他一定想知道选区的变化
He'd like to know the constituency implications.

345
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,678
作为忠诚的内阁成员
As a loyal Cabinet member,

346
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:47,203
我有责任通知首相...和别的事一样
I owe that to the PM amongst other things!

347
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,686
但请注意 大臣 如果记者知道就糟了
Mind you, it would be awful if the press got hold of this.

348
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,042
牵扯到这么多城镇
With so many other boroughs threatened,

349
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,845
举国都会震惊的
there'd be a national outcry.

350
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,919
有没有被他们挖到消息的危险?
Is there a danger of them getting hold of it?

351
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:02,124
他们专会挖这种新闻
They're very clever at getting hold of things.

352
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,996
特别是复印件很多的时候      天啊
Especially if there are lots of copies. Oh, dear!

353
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,398
我应该给内阁同僚们发复印件
I shall have to make copies for my Cabinet colleagues.

354
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,606
他们的选区终究也会受影响的
Their own constituencies will be affected in due course.

355
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,520
如果泄露出去 这么多复印件
And if it were leaked, with so many copies,

356
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,360
没人会知道是谁泄的密
no one would ever discover who leaked it.

357
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,997
刚巧我今天午餐
It so happens I'm having lunch today

358
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,203
约了泰晤士报的麦克斯韦
with Peter Maxwell of The Times.

359
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,482
太棒了
Excellent!

360
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,518
别做我不会做的事
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

361
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,683
请相信我 大臣
You can trust me, Minister!

362
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,957
你一定听到传闻了 彼得
I'm sure you've heard rumours, Peter,

363
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:44,357
这个综合交通政策
of this integrated transport policy.

364
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,600
陈词滥调又来了?      对 但这回很有趣
That old chestnut? Yes, but in an interesting form.

365
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,440
这个政策也许会有负面影响
The policy may have unwelcome side effects.

366
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,642
例如?
Such as?

367
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,879
合并公交铁路站造成的下岗问题
Job loss from integration of bus and rail terminals,

368
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,686
合并维修站的下岗问题
job loss from joint repair shops,

369
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,839
缩减公交和列车线路的下岗问题
job loss from streamlining of buses and trains,

370
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:04,841
减少班次 还是下岗问题
and reduction of services, causing job loss.

371
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,357
这只是开始
That's just for starters.

372
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:12,437
若真要提这个议案 可就轰动了
If this is being seriously proposed, It's quite a story.

373
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:15,519
对 比你想的还有趣 彼得      此话怎讲?
Even more interesting than you think. How's that?

374
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,198
受牵连最严重的
One of the areas to suffer most

375
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,881
是首相自己的选区
Is the Prime Minister's own constituency.

376
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,244
消息确切吗?
Have you any hard facts?

377
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,757
亲爱的彼得 问得真尖锐
Dear Peter, what a question!

378
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,566
报纸和政府可不一样 汉弗莱
Newspapers aren't like the government.

379
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,924
我们发表了声明 得证明它是真的
If we make statements, we have to prove them.

380
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:38,278
总有文件之类的吧? 公务员肯定有
Got something in writing? There always is in the Civil Servlce.

381
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:42,841
只有我们大臣写给首相的密函
Only a confidential note from my minister to the Prime Minister

382
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:47,762
还有他给内阁同僚们的22份类似函件
and a similar note to all 22 Cabinet colleagues.

383
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,684
哦 那就好
Oh, that's all right, then.

384
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:55,204
你要直接给我 还是让我找他们?
Will you show it to me or shall I get it from one of the others?

385
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,881
亲爱的彼得 这可是机密文件
Peter, it抯 a confidential document.

386
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:02,086
我泄露给任何人都属极度失职
It would be grossly improper of me to betray it to anyone

387
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,602
更不用说给记者了      的确
let alone a journalist. Of course.

388
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,156
你唯一拿到一份的机会
The only way you'd get hold of a copy

389
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:11,002
是有人误把它随处乱丢
Is if someone were to leave it lying around by mistake.

390
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,680
我明白了
I see.

391
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,759
哦 我回去干活了
Oh, well, back to the grindstone.

392
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:21,322
很高兴和你谈话 彼得 多谢你的午餐
Well, nice to talk, Peter. Thank you for the lunch.

393
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,478
谢谢      再见
Thank you. Goodbye.

394
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:30,639
哦 汉弗莱 你太大意了
Oh, Humphrey, you are so careless!

395
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,081
啊 吉姆 谢谢你过来
Ah, Jim. Thanks for dropping in.

396
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:43,923
我要先提醒你 首相很生气
I thought I ought to tell you that the PM isn抰 very pleased.

397
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:47,318
哦 生气?      很生气
Oh, not pleased? Not pleased.

398
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:52,957
上周二的泰晤士报      真可怕 我也生气
Last Tuesday's Times. Yes I'm not pleased either.

399
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,600
显然是泄密了      显而易见
There's obviously been a leak. Obviously.

400
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:00,885
内阁同僚都信不过了      什么意思?
Can't even trust Cabinet colleagues. What are you suggesting?

401
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,720
也可能不是他们
Well, it might not have been one of them.

402
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,276
我也送了份复本到10号
I sent a copy of my paper here to No. 10.

403
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,041
你们这儿不会泄密吧?
You don't think there's a leak here, do you?

404
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:13,803
首相办公室绝不会泄密      当然 别瞎想
The PM's office does not leak! Of course not. Perish the thought!

405
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,606
最烦的还不是泄密
It wasn抰 just the leak that was disturbing.

406
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,918
而是对议案内容的曲解
It was the misleading Implications of the proposals.

407
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,999
没有曲解 你读过我的报告吗?
No, not misleading. Have you read my paper?

408
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,805
你读过我的吗?
Have you read mine?

409
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,804
这是首相选区的报纸吧?
This is the paper from the PM's constituency.

410
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,286
似乎是的
I believe it is.

411
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,996
"首相干预并停止交通整顿议案"
"PM steps in to stop transport reorganisation proposals.

412
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,037
"选区的服务和就业受威胁的传闻"
Rumours that services and jobs were threatened

413
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,085
"今日已被粉碎"
in this constituency were scotched today.

414
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,920
"据悉 首相已将明确指示"
Apparently the PM has given a firm direction

415
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:50,681
"给予交通总管吉姆哈克"
to Transport Supremo designate Jim Hacker."

416
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:53,998
我没收到首相指示啊      现在收到了
I haven't heard from the PM. You have now!

417
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,405
恐怕这次泄密 途径暂且不论 确实是
I'm afraid this leak, wherever It comes from, is a verbatim report

418
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,606
首相从渥太华发布的秘密口令
of a confidential minute dictated by the PM in Ottawa.

419
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:09,482
所以 国民交通政策得重新考虑
So, the national transport policy will need some re-thinking!

420
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,719
这可难办了
It will be difficult.

421
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:16,880
首相认为当大臣的就得解决难题
The PM feels it抯 the difficult jobs that the ministers are there for,

422
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,641
如果他们还想当大臣
assuming they wish to remain as ministers.

423
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:21,320
是的 当然
Yes, well, of course.

424
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,396
如果需要...      重新考虑
If it needs, er... Rethinking.

425
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,161
重新考虑 那我就...再考虑
Rethinking, then of course I shall rethink.

426
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,726
很好
Good.

427
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:32,482
可首相选区的报纸怎么知道的?
But how did this get into the PM's own local paper?

428
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:37,437
不知道 但首相办公室绝不会泄密
I don't know. But the PM's office does not leak.

429
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:43,641
真可怕是吧? 如今谁都信不过了
Shocking, though, isn抰 it? You can't trust anyone nowadays.

430
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,600
回到了起点 这也不错
Back to square one. Well, that's all right.

431
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,405
什么不错 大错特错
It is not all right.

432
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,082
这死工作还在我头上
I'm still stuck with this ghastly job.

433
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,158
不 大臣 这是绝好的消息
No, Minister, it is excellent news.

434
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,887
我们现在出台另一种准议案
We now present our other kind of non-proposal.

435
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:01,925
哪一种?      高成本 高编制议案
What other kind? The high cost, high staff kind.

436
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,921
我们提议 设立全国交通管理局
We now propose a British National Transport Authority

437
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:08,965
结构完整 有地区分局 委员会
with a full structure, regional board, area council,

438
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:11,482
办事处 联络委员会 应有尽有
local office, liaison committee, the lot.

439
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:14,445
八万员工 每年十亿预算
80,000 staff, billion-a-year budget.

440
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,197
财政部肯定会绝倒
The Treasury will have a fit!

441
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:21,676
这烂摊子肯定会被踢回交通部
The whole thing will go back to the Department of Transport.

442
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:25,635
好极了 能帮我拟个草案吗 汉弗莱?
Great. Could you do me a paper on this, Humphrey,

443
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:30,278
编制 费用细节和一份年度预算
with full staff and costing details and a specimen annual budget?

444
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:38,005
首页有份简单摘要
There's a one-page summary on the front.

445
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:41,843
汉弗莱  你真了不起      不值一提 大臣
Humphrey, you're marvellous. it抯 nothing, really.

446
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:45,443
这要是被记者搞到手可如何是好
I say, what if the press should get hold of this!

447
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,555
又有一次泄密要调查了
They'd have to have another leak enquiry.

448
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,877
他们真的会调查吗?
Will they really set up an enquiry

449
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:55,436
一定会      不会很尴尬吗?
Bound to. Won't that be embarrassing?

450
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,724
不不 泄密调查就是为这个
No, no, no. That's what leak enquires are for.

451
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,765
做做样子 不会真的调查
Setting up. They don't actually conduct them.

452
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:05,521
也许会委派人员 但他们根本不见面
Members may be appointed, but they'll never meet,

453
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,166
更不会交报告了
and certainly never report.

454
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:10,842
伯纳 你记得几个揪出泄密者的调查?
How many leak enquires can you recall that named the culprit?

455
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:14,966
凑个整数      如果您要整数...
In round figures. If you want it in round figures...

456
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,880
零个      瞧 他们从不报告
None. They never report.

457
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:21,323
如果泄密的是公务员 揪出来就不公平
If the culprit is a civil servant, It'd be unfair to publish.

458
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,886
政客会担责任
Politicians take the rap.

459
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,038
如果是政客 也不能公开
If it抯 a politician, you can't publish

460
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,721
不然他会揭露其他同僚
or he抣l disclose other leaks by his colleagues.

461
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:29,923
但最重要的原因是
But chiefly they can't publish

462
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,601
多数泄密都来自10号
because most leaks come from No. 10.

463
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,205
只有国家这条船 伯纳
The ship of state, Bernard,

464
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,961
是从顶上漏水的
Is the only ship that leaks from the top.

465
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:42,846
所以 如果是首相口无遮拦
So, if the problem is a leaky PM,

466
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,726
就像这次 真相就难揭露了
as in this case, the facts are difficult to get at

467
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:47,843
更不会公开
and impossible to publish if you do!

468
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:52,486
提醒您 大臣 报社有位先生在等您
May I remind you, a gentleman from the press is waiting.

469
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,719
啊 是的      我先离开 大臣
Ah, yes. I'll leave you, Minister.

470
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,447
哦 汉弗莱...      大臣?
Oh, er, Humphrey... Minister?

471
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:02,797
你还有计划书的复本吗?
Have you got another copy of these new proposals?

472
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,036
当然
Of course!

473
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,916
给您      因为我非常健忘
There. Because I'm awfully absent-minded.

474
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:12,762
总把文件到处乱放...
I'm always leaving documents lying around...

475
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:16,847
之后就忘记放在哪了
forgetting where I've put them.

476
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,885
非常了解 大臣
I do understand, Minister!

477
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:26,005
又一个泄密 这次更加严重
Another leak. This is extremely serious.

478
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,486
是的 当然
Yes, indeed.

479
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,324
已经快到惩戒线了
This is almost approaching a disciplinary level.

480
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,957
完全同意 是吧汉弗莱?      当然 大臣
I so agree, don't you, Humphrey? Indeed, Minister.

481
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,322
能找到泄密者就好了
If only we could find the culprits.

482
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,682
事态确实极其严重
It would be a most serious matter.

483
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:41,724
也许我能帮忙
Perhaps I can help there.

484
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:46,323
我认为如果我用上自己的人脉
I think that if I were to use my influence,

485
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:49,365
就能揭露泰晤士报
I could achieve a disclosure from The Times

486
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:52,439
如何得到第一份计划的
of how they got hold of your original plan.

487
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:55,757
哦?      真的?
Oh? Really?

488
00:26:56,527 --> 00:27:00,202
也许我也能帮忙      真的吗?
I might be able to help there, too. Indeed?

489
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,086
您确定吗 大臣?      当然
Are you sure, Minister? Oh, yes.

490
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,035
我有把握找出记者从哪得知
I'm confident I can find out where the press got the leak

491
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,880
首相对提案的异议的
about the PM's opposition to our plan.

492
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:15,006
如果查出是首相办公室泄露的
If it transpired the leak came from the Prime Minister's own office

493
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:19,524
会比内阁大臣办公室泄密更严重吧
that'd be serious than from a Minister's office.

494
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:22,565
我是说 光是安全问题...
I mean, the security implications alone...

495
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,678
也许应该派警察 或者军情局
Perhaps we should call in the police or MI5.

496
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,724
军情局 好主意 大臣
MI5, good idea, Minister.

497
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:34,163
首相办公室泄密 问题可严重了
A leak from the Prime Minister's office Is very serious.

498
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:39,003
不过 首先要调查第一次泄露的问题
our first priority must be the original leak.

499
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:43,558
不 首先要调查10号泄密的可能性
Surely we should first investigate a possible leak from No. 10.

500
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:48,400
无论如何 泄密已经导致全国哗然
In all events, the inevitable public outcry after all these leaks

501
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,718
我们行政部更难以制订
will make it awfully difficult for us to formulate

502
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,118
这份国民综合交通政策
an integrated national transport policy in the DAA.

503
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:58,518
时机尚未成熟 风声仍在盛传
The time is unripe, the cellmate is unsuitable.

504
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:00,882
大气候很不利
The atmosphere is unfavourable.

505
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:04,164
我们唯一的解决途径也行不通了
Our only avenues of approach are now blocked.

506
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:07,640
我在想...
I wonder...

507
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:11,359
是不是应该把整件事
If it might not be wiser to take the whole matter

508
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,757
交还交通部?
back to the Department of Transport?

509
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:20,359
这...阿诺德 真是明智      我怎么想不到
That, Arnold, is a brilliant idea. I wish I'd thought of that.

510
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:25,522
但泄密还没解决      当然
There remains the question of the leaks. Indeed.

511
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:29,566
我认为这事应该严肃处理
I feel we ought to treat this with the utmost gravity.

512
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:32,605
我想到个办法      是什么?
I think I have a solution. Indeed?

513
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,520
你们能向首相建议
Will we recommend to the Prime Minister

514
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:38,599
马上发起一次泄密调查吗?
that we set up an immediate leak enquiry

515
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,159
是 大臣
Yes, Minister!
