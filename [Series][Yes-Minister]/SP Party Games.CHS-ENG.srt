党派之戏

5
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:59,842
伯纳 有急事吗?我得批完这些国防部报告
Bernard, is it important? I must finish these Defence papers.

6
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,601
恐怕这事更紧急 大臣      什么事?
This is more urgent, Minister. What is it?

您的圣诞卡 大臣 不能再拖了
Your Christmas cards can't be postponed any longer.

these Love from Annie and Jim. And those?

12
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,803
这些是印好的 不用签 只要过目一下
those have cyclostyled signatures so you needn't write anything.

13
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:28,677
检查有没有哪些需要亲笔签吉姆或吉姆哈克
Make sure none of them should have been personally signed Jim

14
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,306
或吉姆和安妮或安妮与吉姆哈克
or Jim and Annie or Annie and Jim Hacker

15
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:31,686
或爱你的安妮和吉姆
or Love from Annie and Jim.

16
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,748
那些呢?      那是给选民的
What about those? Constituency cards

17
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,598
您的竞选代理早上送来的
Your agent left them.

18
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,334
您看它们也分好了 这些签吉姆

19
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,683

多谢 伯纳 我明白了
Thank you, Bernard! I think I've got the gist.

21
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:49,523
就这些吗?      政党总部还有
Is that it? Apart from the ones at Party headquarters.

22
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,730
政党总部?去年我可没签
Party HQ? I didn't do those last year.

23
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,926
去年您不是党主席
You weren't Party Chairman last year.

24
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,959
唉 这张非寄不可吗?
Oh. Do I have to send this one?

25
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,199
怎么?      给莫里斯 欧共体的
Why not? It's to Maurice in Brussels.

26
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:03,996
就是他硬要推行欧洲香肠标准化计划
He forced through the plan to standardise the Euro sausage.

27
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,998
欧洲香肠?
Euro sausage?

28
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,046
明年咱们就得跟老英国香肠说再见
Next year we'll be waving goodbye to British sausage,

29
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:12,084
被迫引进那些外国垃圾
forced to accept some foreign muck

30
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:14,609
意大利蒜肠 德国泥肠之类
like salami or bratwurst or something.

31
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,686
他们不能不让我们吃英国香肠啊
They can't stop us eating the British sausage!

32
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,035
他们不让我们叫它香肠
It'll be called the

33
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:22,747
改叫"乳化高脂杂碎筒"
emulsified high-fat offal tube!

34
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,722
您就吞下去啦?
And you swallowed it?

35
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:33,079
我有责任推行欧共体政策嘛 这下我算毁了
It's my job to implement EEC regulations.

36
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:38,321
干吗跟我们的香肠过不去?      你不读报吗?
What they got against our sausage? Don't you ever read the papers?

37
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:41,126
我瞟了一眼 大臣 没能读下去
I glanced at it, but it rather put me off.

38
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,085
显然 他们嫌里面肉不够
Apparently, there's not enough meat in it.

39
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:49,585
"常规英国香肠含有32.5%脂肪 6.5%猪皮"
"The average British sausage consists of 32.5% fat, 6.5% rind,

40
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,103

"20% water, 10% rusk

45
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,401
"以蒸汽从畜体上剥离"
"...steamed off the carcasses."

46
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,599
我觉得有点...我今天...
I don't feel particularly... I had one...

47
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,076
我今天早餐吃了一根
I had one for breakfast.

48
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:17,000
也许欧共体专员说得对
Perhaps the EEC commissioner is right.

49
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:21,046
就算对 选民也不爱听
He may be, but it'll be extremely unpopular with the voters.

50
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,597
算了 我们只好决不松口 反咬回去
We shall just have to grit our teeth and bite on the bullet.

51
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:29,761
如果您不松口 就没法反咬回去 因为...
You can't bite a bullet when gritting your teeth If you do that...

52
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,246
对不起
Sorry.

53
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,365
对了伯纳 你得告诉我
By the way, you were going to advise me

54
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:36,483
给助理办公室送什么礼物
what presents to get for the private office.

55
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:40,720
随您便 大臣 助理秘书送雪利酒
That's up to you. Bottles of sherry for the assistant secretaries,

日程秘书和通信秘书送大盒薄荷糖

其余人送小盒薄荷糖
and small boxes of mints for the rest.

58
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,085
我的私人秘书呢?      哦 那是我
What about my Personal Private Secretary? That's me.

59
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:57,637
啊 对 我要送你什么?      您不用送我东西
Ah, yes, of course You don't have to give me anything.

60
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,765
我知道 伯纳 可我乐意送      哦 大臣
I know, but I'd like to. Oh, Minister...

61
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:04,044
随便 什么都行      比方说?
Well, anything, really. Such as?

62
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:06,641
这个 我比较喜欢惊喜
Well, really I would like a surprise.

63
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,001
要给你什么惊喜?
What sort of surprise should I give you?

64
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,886
按惯例 一瓶香槟酒就很惊喜
A bottle of champagne is the customary surprise.

65
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:20,446
我几点和汉弗莱开会?      这个取消了 大臣
What time is my meeting with Humphrey? That's been cancelled.

66
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,043
汉弗莱爵士和内阁秘书有个紧急会议
Sir Humphrey had an urgent meeting with the Cabinet Secretary.

67
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:28,803
内阁秘书 总让我紧张
The Cabinet Secretary. Always makes me feel rather nervous.

68
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:33,085
可以说 阿诺德爵士是全国最有权力的人
Sir Arnold is the most powerful chap in the country.

69
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:39,004
首相常任秘书 控制内阁议程 一切尽在掌握
controls Cabinet agenda, controls access to everything.

70
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,998
他有什么事?
I wonder what he's up to?

71
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,878
对了 汉弗莱      什么?
By the way, Humphrey... Yes?

72
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,800
我决定提前退休
I've decided to retire early.

73
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,401
真的 阿诺德?
Oh! Have you, Arnold?

74
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,683
就定在新年
In the New Year.

75
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,566
啊
Ah...

76
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:04,726
我的接班人面对政治家得立场坚定
My successor has to be firm with our political masters.

77
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,720
当然 这一点不能含糊
Absolutely. No nonsense with that lot!

78
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,640
还得讲策略      可不是
But tactful... Exactly.

79
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:15,437
温和 迷人 老练...      尤其要可靠
Suave, charming, emollient... And above all, sound.

80
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,041
可靠? 对了 可靠
Sound? Oh, yes, sound.

81
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,041
因此 我有责任为首相举荐
So my duty is to convey a recommendation to the Prime Minister

82
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:27,998
全面符合这些条件的常任秘书

83
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,043
那么 这个...
And, er...

你...这个...现在有没有...
...Have you, er... Er, er, is there, er... Does anyone, er...

85
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,658
你看 这行的真谛不在于找对答案
You see, in this job, the problem isn't really finding the answers

86
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,697
而在于找对问题
it's finding the questions.

87
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:49,156
看谁能找出最关键的问题
We need the man who can find the key question.

88
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,637
对了 阿诺德 换个话题
By the way, Arnold, to change the subject completely,

89
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:04,597
你退休之后打算干什么?      啊 非常好的问题
what will you be doing when you retire? Ah, very good question!

90
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:09,282
问得好      也许有工作要你做
Very good question. There might be jobs you could pick up,

91
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:14,157
继续为国效力 不管你的接班人是谁
ways you could serve the country, which your successor

92
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:17,444
他能给你安排...呃...说服你接受
could put your way er, persuade you to undertake!

93
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,517
我确实有些打算 你看
I had been giving it some thought

94
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:23,372
有人请我做西方银行的董事长
I'll be chairman of the Banque Occidentale

95
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:27,361
IBM和英国石油也有我一席
and there'll be directorships of IBM and BP and so on.

96
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,722
不过我想...      如何?
But I was thinking... Yes?

97
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,119
皇家剧院基金会明年要选主席了
The Chairmanship of the Opera House will be coming up

98
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:39,486
剧院基金会主席...      还有牛津大学名誉校长
Chairman of Covent Garden... And the chancellorship of Oxford.

99
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:43,526
英格兰银行副长一职也很...
The deputy chairmanship of the Bank of England would be a...

100
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:47,475
有挑战性?      挑战性 没错
...A challenge? A challenge, exactly.

101
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,400
还有国安委员会主席
And head of the Security Commission.

102
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:55,118
英国－加勒比协会会长更是...
The Anglo-Caribbean Association would give one...

103
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,404
造福大众的机遇
...a chance to be of service.

104
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,205
正是
Precisely!

105
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,165
尤其在冬天
Especially during the winter months.

106
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,955
我看合格的接班人一定能安排妥当 阿诺德
I'm sure any successor worth his salt could arrange these.

107
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:12,915
你这么想?那我总算放心了
Do you think so? That's very reassuring, very reassuring.

108
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,681
还有另一件事
But there is another thing.

109
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,550
有人对首相提出的建议
Certain advice one may have given the Prime Minister

110
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,595
如果披露出来 会遭到误解
could, if it emerged, be misinterpreted.

111
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,806
什么建议呢?      非常合情合理的
Er, what sort of advice? All sensible and reasonable,

112
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,118
关于罢工中出动军队
but advice about using troops during strikes.

113
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,438
为安全起见 当然要适当武装
A very sensible precaution that they should be armed,

114
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,486
然而建议要配机关枪...
but, taken out of context, machine guns...

115
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,764
哦 这种事绝对没必要披露出去
Oh, I'm sure that need never come out.

116
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:45,877
我还建议过和南非商讨恢复非洲海军基地的事
Negotiations about reactivating the Simonstown naval base.

117
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,742
战略上绝对无可厚非
Absolutely sensible strategically

118
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,262
在马岛事件中尤其有用
a great help with the Falklands,

119
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:56,003
但如果一个人要当联邦秘书长...
but as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth...

120
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,797
那就尴尬了 不消说你一定会当上联邦秘书长
And you will be Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.

121
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,401
会吗?借你吉言啰
Would I? How gratifying!

122
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:10,805
我看合格的接班人一定能妥善保管这些文件

123
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,286
很好
Good.

124
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,007
那么 话说回去
Anyway, to get back to our original point,

125
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:20,924
各位同仁与我都同意你就是第一候选人
My colleagues and I can placing your name top of the list.

126
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,240
这样啊
I see.

127
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:29,077
能否请问还有多少候选人?
May I ask how many other names will be on the list?

128
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,683
哦 我可找不出第二个合格的了
Oh, I don't think there's anyone else who's up to scratch.

129
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,042
再来一杯
Have another drink.

130
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:41,957
顺便告诉你 我会出任信息自由运动主席
I'll be the presidency of the Campaign for Freedom of Information.

131
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,405
信息自由?这从何说起?
Freedom of Information?! What on earth for?

132
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:51,960
反对党很欢迎 今日反对党便是明日执政党
Well, it's very popular with the Opposition

133
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:56,245
也可以保证信息自由不被滥用
and it will mean one can ensure that the freedom is not abused.

134
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:01,719
干杯 敬可靠政府代代相传
So, here's to the continuity of sound government.

135
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:04,526
也敬信息自由
And freedom of information.

136
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,396
以国家利益为准绳      哦
Whenever it's in the national interest. Oh, yes!

137
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,005
大臣 我有个不幸的消息      什么 汉弗莱?
Minister, I have some very grave news. Yes, Humphrey?

138
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,920
与您共掌此部至今 细细想来
The relationship, which I might tentatively aver

139
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,655
虽不敢说肝胆相照 荣辱与共
has been not without a degree of reciprocal utility

140
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,479
倒也合作愉快 相得益彰
and even occasional gratification,

141
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,719
如今却面临分道扬镳 一言以蔽之
is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation and, to be brief,

142
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:41,277
已经走到了令人痛心 无可挽回的终点
is in the propinquity of its ultimate, regrettable, termination.

143
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,286
这样啊
I see.

144
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,599
我...要走了      什么?
I'm... on my way out. What?

145
00:09:54,767 --> 00:10:00,239
命里有时终须有 当一人天数将至...
One has to accept what fate has in store, when one passes on

146
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,920
天数将至?!
Passes on?!

147
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,521
将去到水草丰美之地
...to pastures new, perhaps greener...

148
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:10,205
脱胎换骨 献身于至高无上之权威
In the service of one who is greater than any of us.

149
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,996
汉弗莱 我太痛心了      谢谢您 大臣
Humphrey, I'm so sorry! Thank you, Minister.

150
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,285
你夫人知道吗?      她一直有所察觉
Does Lady Appleby know? She's suspected it for some time.

151
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,086
什么时候通知你的?      今天下午
When did they tell you? This afternoon.

152
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,603
你还有多少时间?      哦 几星期而已
How long do they give you? Just a few weeks.

153
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,086
几星期?
Weeks?!

154
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:29,398
足够我把余下的事务理清了
It'll give me enough time to sort everything out.

155
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,400
汉弗莱 你真是英勇
Humphrey, you're so terribly brave!

156
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,878
紧张是难免的 前路茫茫 总让人恐惧
One is a little anxious. One is always wary of the unknown

157
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:38,489
但我坚信我能应付到底
but I have faith I'll muddle through.

158
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,076
大臣 您怎么了?
Minister, what's the matter?

159
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,836
对不起 汉弗莱
I'm sorry, Humphrey.

160
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:53,125
想我们同甘共苦这么多年...
It's just we've had our ups and downs, but...

161
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,279
大臣 没必要太难过
Oh, Minister, don't take on so!

162
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,727
我们还会常常见面的
We'll still see one another regularly.

163
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,725
至少每周见一次吧      什么?
Yes, once a week at least. What?

164
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,879
我还没说我要去哪里      啊?
I haven't told you where I'm going yet. Eh?

165
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:14,477
我已经被任命为内阁秘书
I have been appointed Secretary to the Cabinet.

166
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,676
内阁秘书?      对呀 您以为是什么?
Secretary to the Cabinet? Why, what did you think?

167
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,997
我...还以为...还以为...
I... I thought... I thought...

168
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:27,083
真对不起 我今天太累 有点反常
Sorry about crying. I'm not myself today, a little tired.

169
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:30,719
这些工作啊 你知道....
Overwrought. Things have been, you know...

170
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,639
我真遗憾
I am so sorry.

171
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,729
也许作为预备内阁秘书
Perhaps as Cabinet Secretary designate

172
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,861
我可以建议首相为您减轻负担...
I should suggest some lightening of the load...

173
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,562
别误会 我很好 真的      那就好
No, no. Don't misunderstand me. I'm fine, fine! Good, good.

174
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:45,037
这么说你要当内阁秘书了      对
So, you're going to be Cabinet Secretary. Yes.

175
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,767
内阁秘书呀      嗯
Cabinet Secretary! Mm-hmm.

176
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,600
内阁的秘书      是
Secretary to the Cabinet! YES!

177
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,396
那太光荣了 恭喜 汉弗莱     谢谢您
That's a great honour. Congratulations. Thank you.

178
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:58,037
不过 这样一来你和我就...      很遗憾 是的
'Course, that means that you and I... Alas, yes.

179
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:01,119
我怎么办呢?      可能您没了我更好
How shall I manage? Probably even better without me.

180
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,484
对 可能...不不不 没那事
Yes, I probably... No, no, certainly not, no!

181
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:10,085
汉弗莱 你要让首相也见识见识你对付我那套...
You're going to do for the PM what you've always done to me.

182
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,646
帮助我
For me!

183
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,155
首相的左右手
PM's right-hand man.

184
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:19,240
参谋政务      正是
Advising on issues. Quite so.

185
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,286
还有...人事 对吧
And, er, and people, no doubt.

186
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,244
大臣?
Minister?

187
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,956
汉弗莱      什么事 大臣?
Humphrey... Yes, Minister?

188
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:33,484
我想说 我一直觉得你非常优秀
I want you to know I think you've been absolutely wonderful.

189
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,388
我极其崇敬你做的一切工作
Highest admiration for all you've done

190
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,369
非常出色 非常出色
Wonderful work. Wonderful work.

191
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,716
公务员传统的典范      大臣 您过奖了
Finest tradition of the service. Minister, you're too kind.

192
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,357
希望你也觉得我...我的...
I just hope you feel that I... In my...

193
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,322
一直以来...这个...
When things are... Well, it...

194
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,682
说起来...
If it should come up, er...

195
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:56,078
我们两个一向合作无间 对吧?
I think we've made a jolly good team here, you and I?

196
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:59,085
我没法盼望比您更好的大臣
I couldn't have wished for a better Minister

197
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,550
汉弗莱 你太好了
Humphrey, you're too kind!

198
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,165
你升迁的事什么时候通报部里?
When are you going to tell the staff?

199
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,239
周五晚上 官方正式宣布之前
On Friday evening, just before it's promulgated.

200
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:13,765
我会借圣诞酒会向大家告别      那可太开心了
I will bid them farewell at the Christmas party

201
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:18,122
并且痛心      痛心 对
And sad. Sad, yes, sad.

202
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,039
痛心之至
Terribly sad.

203
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:24,046
玩得好吗?      很好 谢谢 大臣
Enjoying yourself? Yes, thank you, Minister.

204
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,517
玩得好吗?      谢谢 酒会很好
Enjoying yourself? Yes, Minister. Lovely party.

205
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:32,238
是的大臣 真是太开心了      放纵一下总是好的
Yes, it's frightfully good fun. Always good to let your hair down.

206
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:40,199
好吧 现在我想说几句
Right, now I think it's time I said a few words.

207
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:44,437
此时此刻对我们所有人都有重大意义
This is a very, very special occasion for us all.

208
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,838
四海升平 诸君幸福美满
Peace on Earth, goodwill to all men.

209
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,123
抱歉 是“诸位”
Sorry, persons!

210
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:55,961
很高兴能和大家欢聚一堂 诸位都是为我...
Good to have this little get-together who've served me, er...

211
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,613
与我...为我...与我一同
...worked with me... for me... no, with me

212
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,477
效力于这个行事...
here at the Department of Adminis...

213
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,563
政事行务...
...Ministry of Administr...

214
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,478
行政部
...at the DAA.

215
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:13,604
我们是个团队 就像内阁 除了我们站同一边
We're a team, like the Cabinet, except we're all on the same side...

216
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,879
并不是说内阁就...不过 我是说影子内阁
Not that the Cabinet... Well, I meant... really, the shadow Cabinet.

217
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,164
如此佳节 就不谈政治了
Let's keep politics out of this. Season of goodwill.

218
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:27,319
这就是为什么圣诞期间不召开国会
That's why Parliament doesn't sit over Christmas!

219
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:34,636
我也要祝各位万事如意 当官的也一样
Season of goodwill. Even to one's officials!

220
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,486
我还能说什么呢?敬小汉
Well, what can I say? Humphrey.

221
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,117
敬汉弗莱阿普比爵士      敬汉弗莱阿普比爵士
(BERNARD) Sir Humphrey Appleby! (ALL) Sir Humphrey Appleby!

222
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:47,909
谢谢 首先我衷心感谢各位
Thank you. I'd just like to thank you all for

223
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,029
多年以来的辛勤工作
all the hard work you've done all these years.

224
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:56,561
如此时刻总令人心中五味杂陈 悲欣交集
Occasion like this engenders a certain emotional ambiguity

225
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,003
他在交集啥?      尽管他可以说
What's he ambigulous about? While one is, one should say,

226
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:04,319
他的离别乃是一种荣光 却也不免黯然
honoured by the cause of departure, saddened by the fact

227
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:11,006
尤其不忍告别其职业生涯中无可比拟的大臣阁下
in particular leave the service of a Minister without parallel

228
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,317
说得真好
I say, that's jolly decent.

229
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,160
打破这独特的伙伴关系      确实独特
A unique partnership. Absolutely unique.

230
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,763
最后请让我祝各位圣诞快乐
So I should end by wishing a happy Christmas to you all,

231
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:24,523
尤其为我们的大臣 尽管相聚时光短暂
In particular to a Minister in the brief time with us

232
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:28,999
我们仍可以看出他日渐庄严 稳健 从不动摇
we've watched grow in standing, stature and sureness of touch.

233
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,637
最后 祝大家新年快乐
So, seasonal felicitations to you all,

234
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,756
不过 请牢牢记住内政大臣的节日号召
Do remember the Home Secretary's campaign for the holiday:

235
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,521
圣诞期间 请别酒后驾车
Don't drink and drive this Christmas.

236
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,360
我要为这个干一杯...哎呀抱歉
I'll drink to that! ...Oh, dear, I'm sorry!

237
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:51,517
真的应该让我来开 吉姆      我开得非常稳
I do wish you'd let me drive, Jim. I'm driving perfectly stably.

238
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,599
稳倒稳 不过天亮之前总得到家吧
True, but we have to get home before dawn!

239
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,440
晚上好 警罐先生 生蛋快乐
Good evening, Cinstable. Happy Crispsmas.

240
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,519
请出示驾照 先生      好的
May I see your licence, sir? Certainly.

241
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:35,077
您是吉姆哈克先生吧?      没错
Aren't you Mr Jim Hacker? That's right.

242
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:40,116
有问题吗?      您为什么开这么慢?
What's trouble? Why you driving so slowly?

243
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,721
我不想被马路牙子撞...
I didn't want the kerb to hit me...

244
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:46,004
不想撞上马路牙子
I didn't want to hit the kerb.

245
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,557
等等 我有交通银章
Look, I've got a silver badge somewhere.

246
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:52,642
好吧 不如让伊万警官替您开车
I see. Perhaps Constable Evans can drive you

247
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,695
不必了 警官 我来开
It's all right, Officer. I'll drive.

248
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,123
好吧 哈克夫人 如果您的状态适合驾驶的话
OK, Mrs Hacker. If you're in a proper state to drive.

249
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,996
我不喝酒 警官 至少在我丈夫开车的时候
I don't drink, Officer. Well, not when my husband's driving.

250
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,121
我也是 基本没喝
Nor do I, hardly.

251
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:14,484
请进来      你这小地方不错嘛 汉弗莱
There we are. Nice little place you have here, Humphrey.

252
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:18,435
谢谢 大臣      第一次内阁会议主持得挺好
Thank you. You handled your first Cabinet meeting well.

253
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:23,203
坐在首相身边感觉怎样?      您请坐 大臣
What was it like sitting next to the PM? Do sit down, Minister.

254
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,754
请您来喝咖啡 是因为
I've asked you to drop in for a coffee because

255
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,506
内政部报告我一起交通事故
the Home Office informs me of a traffic incident.

256
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:34,039
我明白了      这完全是您的私事
Yes, I see. It's entirely your own affair...

257
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
那当然      但据说首相看得很重
Precisely. But the PM takes a grave view.

258
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,189
他认为大臣应当以身作则
He feels Ministers should set an example

259
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,882
汉弗莱 你不是在训斥我吧?
You're not ticking me off, are you?

260
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,324
哪里话 大臣 我只是卑微的内阁办事员
I'm only a servant a humble functionary.

261
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,718
但我得向内政部保证下不为例
But I need to assure the Home Office it won't occur again.

262
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:54,358
那银章是干吗用的?      这是一项特权 大臣
What silver badges for? It's a special privilege, Minister.

263
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:59,647
特许我们驶入警戒线或在禁止停车处停车
Pass through police cordons and park in prohibited areas

264
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,924
并不是保护酒后驾车用的
It is not to protect drunks who drive cars.

265
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:09,755
我不要挨办事员的训 你这种地位的也不行
I will not be lectured by a functionary

266
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:14,717
我是堂堂御前大臣      当然 大臣 我十分抱歉
I'm a Minister of the Crown. Yes, of course. I do apologise.

267
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,926
我会照您的意思 上报女王陛下
I will inform the Crown of the incident if that is your wish.

268
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,365
我...
I...

269
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:29,638
算了 你可以告诉内务部我接受教训了
Now I think of it, you can tell the Home Office I take the point.

270
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:34,756
谢谢您 大臣      内务部长知道吗?
Thank you, Minister. Does the Home Secretary himself know?

271
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,202
这倒无所谓
It hardly matters.

272
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,804
恐怕内务部长没有您幸运
I'm afraid the Home Secretary has not been as lucky as you were,

273
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,606
所以他今天没出席内阁
which is why he wasn't at Cabinet.

274
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:51,242
您也知道 他亲自发起"圣诞勿酒后驾车"运动
He initiated "Don't drink and drive" campaign

275
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:53,682
命令警方"严惩肇事者"
and ordered the police to "get tough".

276
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,599
不幸的是
Well, unfortunately...

277
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:01,515
昨晚他也因酒后驾车被捕 在他自己的选区
he, too, was picked up last night for drunken driving

278
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,479
您看旗帜晚报第一版了吗?
Have you seen the first edition of the Standard?

279
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:15,440
他的警卫员哪去了?      显然被他甩掉了
Where on earth was his security man? He'd given him the slip.

280
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:18,599
您知道这些醉鬼多狡猾
You know how cunning these drunks can be.

281
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:24,036
这事难道不能遮过去?用银章呢?
Couldn't they have hushed it up? Silver badge job?

282
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:28,005
他的情况特殊 他撞翻了一台卡车
His case was rather different. He caused a lorry to overturn

283
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:30,763
里面满载核废料
It was full of nuclear waste.

284
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:38,797
他弹回来 正中地方报纸主编的车
rebounded into a car driven by the editor of a local newspaper.

285
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,286
不会吧
Oh, no.

286
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,405
自然就泄漏了      核废料?
Inevitably, it leaked out. The nuclear waste?

287
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,159
不 是消息
No, the story.

288
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:50,602
内务大臣非辞职不可了      唉 可不是
The Home Secretary will have to resign. Alas, yes.

289
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,235
要把他怎样呢?      这个嘛
What will happen to him? Well...

290
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:55,054
既然他醉得跟个爵爷一样
I gather he was as drunk as a lord

291
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:57,848
大概要冷藏一阵 然后封个爵吧
so after a discreet interval, they'll probably make him one!

292
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,520
他肯定被留下了
He's obviously been held up.

293
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,525
你等的时候 可以帮忙贴贴邮票
You can stamp some cards if you like.

294
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,757
不是给选民的吗?      是
Aren't they to constituents? Yes.

295
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:15,684
那就不是政府行为 是政治行为 我无权插手
That's political activity. I'm not allowed to help.

296
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,281
要是给记者的呢?      那就可以
If they're to journalists? That'd be OK.

297
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,722
这些是给记者的      好
They're to journalists. Fine.

298
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:25,405
恐怕媒体公关的本质就是一个个舔过来
Licking is essential of relationships with the press.

299
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:31,645
我听说内阁要改组      对 新闻可能会报
I hear the reshuffle is about to be announced.

300
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:36,005
我喜欢看新闻 最容易找到吉姆在哪
It's my best chance of finding out where Jim is.

301
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:41,161
此事显然与美国军方有联系
<i>There was no question of American military involved.</i>

302
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:45,320
插播一条简讯 来自唐宁街10号
<i>We've j'ust had a newsflash from Number 10 Downing Street.</i>

303
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,604
首相将于新年期间提前退休
<i>The Prime Minister is to retire early in the New Year.</i>

304
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,645
他声称不打算进入下届议会
<i>He does not want to serve in another Parliament,</i>

305
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:55,083
以便接班人顺利执政 继而参加普选
<i>giving his successor a good run-up to the next election.</i>

306
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,364
我们将尽快播发后续报道
<i>We'll bring you further news as soon as we can.</i>

307
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,802
听见没有?      听见了
(ALL) Have you heard? (ALL) Yes!

308
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:04,801
内阁紧急会议就说这个      怎么这么突然?
The emergency Cabinet meeting was to tell us. Why so suddenly?

309
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:08,026
首相说是为了便于接班人参选
He said to give his successor a good run-up to the next election

310
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:10,303
所以肯定不是为这个
so that can't be the reason.

311
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:14,562
那为什么?      有各种神奇的流言
Why, then? Some extraordinary rumours are going about.

312
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,480
左翼说他是中情局的密探
The left say he's a secret CIA agent.

313
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,920
右翼说他是克格勃的密探
The right say he's a secret KGB agent

314
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,639
大臣 我听到的完全不同
Minister, I've heard something quite different,

315
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,176
说有价值一百万的南非钻石
that there is ? million-worth of diamonds from South Africa

316
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,748
藏在唐宁街保险箱里
in a Downing Street safe,

317
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,037
但这只是流言      真的假的?
but it's only a rumour. Is that true?

318
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,526
真的
Yes.

319
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:36,122
这么说唐宁街真有钻石
So, there ARE all those diamonds in Downing Street!

320
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,676
有吗?      你说有的
Are there? You said there were!

321
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,599
我没说      你说了
I didn't. You did!

322
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,146
你说有流言 我问真的假的 你说是真的
I said is the rumour true, you said yes!

323
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:44,648
真的有这流言
True it's a rumour.

324
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,876
你听说是真的      真的只是听说
You heard it was true! True I heard it!

325
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:49,968
抱歉打扰你们的重要谈话 不过你相信吗?
Sorry to cut in, but do you believe it?

326
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,032
我相信我听说过
I believe I heard it.

327
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:55,157
钻石吗?不信      不可能吗?
Oh, about the diamonds? No. Is it impossible?

328
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:58,285
不是 不过官方从未否认过
No, but it's never been officially denied.

329
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:02,804
政治第一定律 只有官方否认的才可信
First rule of politics: Never believe anything until it's officially denied.

330
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,437
会举行普选吗?      没必要
Will there be a general election? There's no need.

331
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,997
我们已经是多数派了 选个新党魁就行
The majority's big enough. We'll just choose a new leader.

332
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,681
你想当吗?      我?没指望
Do you want the job? Me? No chance!

333
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,361
要么埃里克 要么邓肯
It'll either be Eric or Duncan.

334
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,439
本来是雷的 他是副党魁
It should have been Ray. He was Deputy Leader.

335
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,485
不过他得辞去内政部长职位...
But as he's had to resign as Home Secretary...

336
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:27,121
当然 所以首相要辞职      为什么?
Of course! That's why the PM resigned! (BERNARD) Why?

337
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:30,452
他一向讨厌雷 他拖到今天
He's always hated Ray. He just hung on

338
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:32,950
就为了避免副党魁上位
to make sure his deputy didn't get the leadership!

339
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,159
就像艾德礼对付莫里森
Like Attlee and Morrison.

340
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:40,957
所以他辞职 好让新党魁趁普选前进入10号?
So it is to give time for the new leader to be run in?

341
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,434
现在内政部长可进去了
Now that the Home Secretary's been run in

342
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:46,076
埃里克想要我支持他
Eric wants my support for the leadership.

343
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:50,759
他很合适 他是个成功的财政部长
He could be the right man. He's been a fairly successful Chancellor.

344
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,761
我已经暗示我会...倒向他
I've already indicated that I'm... on his side.

345
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,602
邓肯呢?      对 邓肯也不错
What about Duncan? Yes, Duncan could be the man.

346
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,565
他在外交部干得挺好
He's done fairly well at the Foreign Office.

347
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,711
我打算支持邓肯
I think I'll support Duncan

348
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,844
你支持埃里克和邓肯两个?
You're supporting Eric AND Duncan?

349
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:10,199
无所谓 如果我支持埃里克而邓肯赢了 没办法
It's all very well, but if I support Eric and Duncan gets it, that's it.

350
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,922
如果我支持邓肯而埃里克赢了
If I support Duncan and Eric gets it

351
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:14,385
也没办法      干脆两边都不支持
that's it. Don't support either!

352
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,844
那谁赢了 我都没办法      你到底支持谁?
Whoever gets it, that's it. So who are you supporting?

353
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,759
邓肯
Duncan.

354
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,286
或者埃里克
Or Eric.

355
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:29,525
邓肯争议太大 要是为党派着想
Duncan's so divisive. It really would be for the good of the party,

356
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,236
为国家着想      埃里克 我怎么能...
the good of the country... Eric, I don't see how I can.

357
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:37,320
你的支持至关重要 你人缘好
Your support would be crucial. You're universally popular...

358
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:40,001
我不知道...      公众形象好
I don't know... Good public image...

359
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,556
没错      大家都说你可靠
Yes... Regarded as sound.

360
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,639
是吗?      所以如果你倒向我这边
Am I? So, if you put your weight behind me...

361
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:49,004
可我毕竟是党主席
You see my problem as chairman of the party.

362
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:53,080
如果邓肯当选呢?你就惨了      这个嘛...
What would happen if Duncan got it? Disaster! Well...

363
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:56,523
告诉你 我连外交部都不给他
Tell you what. I wouldn't keep him at the Foreign Office.

364
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,875
我要任命新外交部长
I'd look for a new Foreign Secretary.

365
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:08,039
我说过 我必须表现得中立
But as I said, I must appear impartial.

366
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:13,758
不过如果有办法暗示我的支持...
But if there could be ways of hinting at my support for you...

367
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,599
暗示得完全中立
...in a perfectly impartial way...

368
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,910
可是邓肯 作为党主席...
But Duncan, as chairman of the party...

369
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,936
正因为你是主席 分量才重
As such you carry even more weight.

370
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,723
你没树过什么敌 暂时还没有
You haven't got any real enemies. Not yet, anyway.

371
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,765
但职责要求我保持中立
But it's my job to be impartial.

372
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:38,966
要是埃里克当选 国家就遭殃了      对
If Eric got into Number 10 it'd be catastrophic. Yes...

373
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:42,164
吉姆 我们在同一战线吧?
Jim, we're on the same side, aren't we?

374
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,640
对      那就好
Yes. Good.

375
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:48,277
我一定会赢 我不会忘掉跟我作对的人
I'm going to win and I never forgive people who let me down.

376
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,965
我不能太公开支持
I can't make my support too public.

377
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:58,405
不用公开 大家心里清楚就好
It doesn't have to be public, just so long as everybody knows.

378
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:03,765
等我进了10号 埃里克去了北爱尔兰...
Then when I'm in Number 10, and Eric's in Northern Ireland...

379
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:12,203
谁做财政部长就很清楚了 对吧?      是吗?
we know who'll be the next Chancellor, don't we? Do we?

380
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,877
你是说...?
You mean...?

381
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:19,399
还是你自己想去北爱尔兰?
Unless you fancy Northern Ireland yourself?

382
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:31,960
信息自由运动进展如何?
How are things at the Campaign for the Freedom of Information?

383
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,402
抱歉 我无权透露
Sorry, I can't talk about that.

384
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:42,856
新首相会是我们伟大的财长
So, will the new PM be our eminent Chancellor

385
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:45,719
还是卓越的外长呢?
or our distinguished Foreign Secretary?

386
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:48,445
我正想问你 你觉得应该是谁?
Well, which do you think it should be?

387
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:53,397
不好说 这就像选个疯子管理精神病院
Difficult. Like asking which lunatic should run the asylum.

388
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:58,687
问题是 他们都信奉干涉主义 要是当首相
Trouble is, they're both interventionists with notions

389
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,680
一定事必躬亲     谁站我们这边?
if they became PM. Have we any allies?

390
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,520
许多人 尤其是总组织秘书
Quite a few, the Chief Whip particularly.

391
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,333
他担心谁当选都会
He's worried that who gets the job will

392
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,564
清算对手的支持者
antagonise the other's supporters

393
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:13,765
使党派分裂      所以要另找个折衷的
and split the party. So we need a compromise candidate.

394
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,963
嗯 可塑性强的
Hmm. Malleable.

395
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:17,685
灵活的      随和的
Flexible. Likeable.

396
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,838
立场不坚定      观点不突出
No firm opinions. No bright ideas.

397
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:25,604
思维不敏锐      没能力改变现状
Not intellectually committed. No strength of purpose to change anything.

398
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:29,885
公认的好操纵 懂得接受引导
Someone who can be manipulated, professionally guided.

399
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,960
将国家大事留给专家处理
leave the business of government in the hands of the experts.

400
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,763
天呐 天呐 天呐 办不到
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear! It's impossible.

401
00:26:56,927 --> 00:27:03,446
怎么?政府里很多人喜欢不干涉的领导
A lot would welcome a less-interventionist leader.

402
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:07,236
那两个候选人不喜欢      可以说服他们
Not the other two candidates! They might be persuaded.

403
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:08,248
什么 让他们退出?
What, to stand aside?

404
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:11,944
你看了他们的军情五处档案吗?
Yes. Have you seen their Ml5 files?

405
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:17,199
没有      一定要看内阁大臣的安全档案
No. Always send for Cabinet Ministers' Ml5 files

406
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,881
如果你想找乐子的话
if you enjoy a good laugh!

407
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:23,997
哦 伯纳      爵士
Oh, Bernard. Sir.

408
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,601
就这些      多谢你
Just... Thank you very much.

409
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,917
请坐下      谢谢
Do sit down. Thank you.

410
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,165
顺便 新年快乐      多谢您
Happy New Year, by the way. Thank you.

411
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:35,840
好的
Right.

412
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,360
那么
So...

413
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:42,565
这是我在行政部最后一件事了
...this is our very last piece of DAA business

414
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:44,213
恐怕是的 汉弗莱爵士
Yes, I'm afraid so, Sir Humphrey.

415
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,760
啊 好吧
Ah, well.

416
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:50,123
伯纳 我问你个问题
Bernard, just let me ask you something.

417
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,884
你愿不愿意你的现任上司...
What would you say to your present master...

418
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:58,755
当下届首相?
...as the next Prime Minister?

419
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,804
你说大臣?      对
The Minister? Yes.

420
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,844
哈克先生?      对
Mr Hacker? Yes.

421
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:09,241
当首相?      对
As Prime Minister? Yes.

422
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:11,821
你赶时间吗?
Are you in a hurry?

423
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:15,125
不 我看看今天是不是愚人节
Just checking it's not April 1st.

424
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:24,039
你觉得你的大臣当不了首相吗?
you mean your Minister is not up to Prime Minister?

425
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,880
当然不 阿诺德爵士 我没资格...
Oh, no, Sir Arnold, it's not for me to, er...

426
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:31,120
我是说...当然...我认为他...
Well, I mean... Of course, I'm... I'm sure he's, er...

427
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,360
哦 天呐
Oh, gosh!

428
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:38,964
许多人看到这一委任有种种好处
There are many advantages in the appointment.

429
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,516
对英国      对英国
For Britain. For Britain.

430
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,759
对 好吧      所以我们交待给你
Yes, well, yes... So we trust you

431
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:48,477
确保你的大臣未来几周内
to ensure your Minister does nothing incisive

432
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,747
不要过激 不要引起争议
or divisive over the next few weeks.

433
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:56,922
避免一切反对意见      任何事都不要明确表态
Expresses no firm opinion about anything.

434
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:03,484
明白了吗?      好吧 反正他本来也打算这么做
is that clear? I think that's what he was planning anyway.

435
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,457
这一切都是为什么 伯纳?
What's it all for, Bernard?

436
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,216
我们在做什么? 有什么意义?
What are we all doing? What does it all mean?

437
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,646
我没学过神学 大臣
I didn't read theology, Minister.

438
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:20,356
全是无用功 就说昨晚欧共体的宴会
The waste of it all. Take that EEC reception last night.

439
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:22,741
汉弗莱向我介绍一位官员
Humphrey introduced me to an official

440
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,602
专门雇佣农民生产过剩粮食
who pays farmers to produce surplus food

441
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:32,757
又介绍另一位 他雇佣人们销毁过剩粮食
and then another official who pays to destroy the surpluses.

442
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:38,399
然后雇几千名官僚制造大批公文 让他们运转
Then they pay thousands of bureaucrats to make it all work.

443
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:41,377
看了这些 你不郁闷吗 伯纳?
Doesn't the futility of it all depress you?

444
00:29:41,377 --> 00:29:43,230
不 大臣 我是公务员
Not really. I'm a civil servant.

445
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,920
我和埃里克和邓肯都谈过了
I've been talking to Eric and Duncan.

446
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,839
我好像答应支持埃里克
I think I've promised to support Eric's candidature.

447
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:56,841
好吧      然后我好像又答应支持邓肯
I see. Then I think I promised to support Duncan's.

448
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,234
这很公平 大臣
That sounds very even-handed, Minister.

449
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:02,034
对 但我总要食言一次 雪利酒?
But I can't keep both promises. Sherry?

450
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,638
谢谢您 这只是政治许诺而已吧 大臣
Thank you. They were only political promises.

451
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,063
对...怎么讲?
Yes... What do you mean?

452
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:11,040
就像您的竞选纲领 人们会理解的
I mean, like your manifesto promises, people understand.

453
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,526
没错
Yes.

454
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:18,444
问题在于 他们俩也没明确许诺我什么
But non of them made any categorical promises to me.

455
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:22,919
那您就没顾虑了      当然有 我总得支持一方
Then you have no problem. Have decide who to support.

456
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,682
不仅仅是押宝的问题 我的态度举足轻重
It's not just picking the winner. My support could tip the balance.

457
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:31,557
问题在于我想做外长还是财长?
Do I want to be Foreign Secretary or Exchequer?

458
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,400
都不想 是吗?      为什么不呢?
Neither, do you? Why not?

459
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,127
两边都是苦差
They're both such terrible jobs!

460
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:40,518
你说的可是内阁三大宝座之二
You're talking about two of the top three Cabinet jobs.

461
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,086
我明白 大臣
I realise that.

462
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,956
伯纳 你是公务员 你不懂政治      抱歉
As a civil servant, you don't understand politics. Sorry.

463
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:48,687
政治成功就在于曝光
To be a success, you have to be in the limelight.

464
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,875
财政部长受万众瞩目 一定能增加选票
You have a very high profile as Chancellor of the Exchequer

465
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:57,926
你明白吧?      对 可是恕我直言 大臣
You see now, don't you? But with respect, Minister...

466
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:02,126
财政部长最煞风景 他得提高烟酒税率
The Chancellor is Mr Killjoy. Raising taxes on beer and cigarettes

467
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:06,565
降低公共设施预算 很招选民怨恨
cutting down public spending goes badly with electorate.

468
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:13,600
我还是别当财政部长了 根本没出路
Maybe I don't want to be Chancellor of the Exchequer.

469
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:18,887
没有 大臣 除非他们再挤兑您去管外交部
Unless you're sent to the Foreign Office as punishment.

470
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:21,720
挤兑?      对 这个工作更惨
Punishment? It's an even worse job.

471
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:24,321
国外赚不到选票?      正是
No votes in Foreign Affairs? Exactly.

472
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:28,036
外交部善待外国人 国民却希望越狠越好
The FCO loves foreigners, but the British people don't.

473
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,799
可不是
Quite.

474
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:34,440
从世界局势看来 外交部可有可无
As far as world politics goes, the Foreign Office is an irrelevance.

475
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:38,998
我们又没有实权 就是个美军导弹基地
We've no real power. We're just an American missile base!

476
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,646
没错 大臣
Yes, Minister.

477
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:43,640
前有虎穴 后有狼窝
Between the devil and the deep blue sea.

478
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:47,038
除非...您还有一种选择
Unless... Of course, there is one other option.

479
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,801
是什么?      中间路线
What other option? Do the middle job.

480
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:55,644
中间?内政部吗?管那些抢劫 越狱 种族骚乱?
Home Secretary? Responsible for all the muggings, race riots?

481
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:59,925
免了吧 谢谢      不是 是获取所有功劳的职位
No, thank you! No, be the one who takes all the credit.

482
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,845
你指什么?该不会...
What do you mean? You mean...?

483
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,516
你不是说...?
You don't mean...?

484
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:13,319
你真的是说...?
You do mean...?

485
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,799
那么 组织秘书处意下如何?
How's it all looking from the Chief Whip's office?

486
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,764
你知道 如果埃里克当选
You know, If Eric gets it

487
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:20,820
不出三个月党派就会分裂
we'll have a party split in three months.

488
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,242
要是邓肯 不出三个星期
If it's Duncan, it'll take three weeks.

489
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:27,116
杰弗里 首相要我对你寄予完全信任
Geoffrey, the PM's asked me to take you into my confidence.

490
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:33,237
本不该告诉你 但是怎么说呢 他们有安全问题
I shouldn't tell you but there are security question marks

491
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:35,875
两位候选人都有
over both the current candidates.

492
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:39,926
什么安全问题?      唉 我不能透露
What question marks? Alas, I can say no more.

493
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:45,442
首相不在 这又是党内事务
The only person I can disclose this to in the PM's absence,

494
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:49,316
我只能透露给一个人 就是党主席
and as it is a party matter, is the chairman of the party.

495
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,921
吉姆哈克      对 他答应会来
Jim Hacker. He's promised to join us.

496
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:56,478
不过眼下 党内有折衷的候选人吗?
But do you think the party can find a compromise candidate?

497
00:32:56,647 --> 00:33:03,200
少说有五六个      你考虑过党主席本人吗?
Could be half a dozen. Have you considered the chairman?

498
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,083
吉姆哈克?
Jim Hacker?!

499
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,482
吉姆哈克...
Jim Hacker...

500
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,956
有可能的 对不对?
Yes, it is possible, isn't it?

501
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:17,006
毕竟 更糟的首相我们也选过
After all, there have been less likely Prime Ministers.

502
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,280
对...
Yes...

503
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,720
哪位?
Who?

504
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,486
肯定有的吧
Oh, there must have been!

505
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,763
抱歉
Sorry

506
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:31,761
什么?好的 请他进来
Yes? Oh, all right. Send him in.

507
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,281
大臣 您能来太好了
Minister, so good of you to call.

508
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,199
亨利      早安
Henry. Morning.

509
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,676
请坐
Do sit down. Minister...

510
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,237
大臣 我有个问题 想请您帮忙
...I have a problem and I need your help.

511
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,285
天啊天啊 你一个人治理不了国家吗?
Oh, dear! Can't you run the country on your own?

512
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:55,120
是的 恐怕状况很严重      对 当然
It is a rather grave matter, I'm afraid. Yes, of course.

513
00:33:56,207 --> 00:34:01,406
事关大选 首相不得不请您来商议
About the election. The PM felt we had to call you in.

514
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,285
到这地步啦?
That bad, eh?

515
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,925
有某些秘密信息
There are certain items of confidential information

516
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,921
尽管从理论上看来无可厚非
In theory might be susceptible of interpretation,

517
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:14,966
却也不乏含糊暧昧之处
do nevertheless contain a sufficient element of ambiguity,

518
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:19,325
如果存心不以善意度之
were they to be presented in a less than generous manner,

519
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:23,162
可能会造成尴尬 甚至有
might be a source of great embarrassment and even hazard

520
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:29,004
危及高度敏感机关公信力之虞
to impinge upon the deliberations of more sensitivity.

521
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,478
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

522
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:39,003
他是说安全问题      安全问题?怎么讲?
About security question marks. Security? What do you mean?

523
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,204
机密      我知道什么是安全问题
Secrets. I know what security means.

524
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:45,837
但你什么意思?      我又没权知道
But what do you mean? I'm not allowed to know.

525
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,804
为什么?      安全问题
Why not? Security.

526
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:55,278
您看 大臣 既然首相不在 党务由您负责
Since in the PM's absence you are deputising on party matters,

527
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:59,565
请看这个 财政大臣的安全档案
I can show you the file on the Chancellor of the Exchequer?

528
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:03,163
理论上讲 不该给您看 但是...
Technically, I can't show you any of it, but, er...

529
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:11,205
基于目前局势 我感到您必须有所了解
under the circumstances, I can show you relevant items.

530
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:15,076
这是安全部门的报告摘要
Here's a summary of the reports from the security services.

531
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,318
政治保安处...
Special Branch...

532
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,045
给您
There we are.

533
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,846
对了 他司机的供述
Interview with his driver.

534
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:28,758
还有首相的私人备忘
And the PM's confidential memo.

535
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,284
当然都严格保密      当然
Strictest secrecy, of course. Of course.

536
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:38,598
老色...
Dirty old...!

537
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:43,800
真想不到他还有这闲工夫
You wouldn't have thought he had the time,

538
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,197
埃里克那种工作狂
a workaholic like Eric.

539
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:50,519
我发现在一个领域活跃的人
I've found that people who are highly active in one area

540
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,326
一般其它领域也不弱
tend to be equally active in all the others.

541
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,637
谁能看出他这么热爱...
You wouldn't think he went in for...

542
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:59,959
似乎时下的说法是"平行慢跑" 大臣
I understand the current expression is horizontal jogging

543
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:07,202
这些事都有年头了吧 证据也不确凿
All this was some time ago and it doesn't seem very conclusive.

544
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,677
对对 所以首相让他当财长
That's why the PM thought it all right for him to be Chancellor.

545
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:14,078
但说到南斯拉夫那位和南非的两位
But the Yugoslavian one and the two South Africans,

546
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,125
更不用提阿根廷那位神秘女士...
not to mention the shady lady from Argentina...

547
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:22,077
有人觉得她只是个幌子      幌子?怎么讲?
And it's thought she's just a cover anyway. Cover? What for?

548
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,726
我的天
Good heavens!

549
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:26,675
如果这些女士都是幌子
If all these ladies were just covers

550
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:29,367
那他到底有什么...需求?
what on earth were his real requirements?

551
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,804
我还真没法说      哦
I really can't tell you. Ooh!

552
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:39,995
所以国防部和外交部就比较微妙了
So it was thought that Foreign Office might be too delicate.

553
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:43,523
那可不是      如果他当上首相
I can see that! Then, if he were PM...

554
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:47,123
安全部门也会落到他手中 后果不堪设想
Head of security services as well. It's unthinkable.

555
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,260
你是说得选邓肯
You're saying it's got to be Duncan.

556
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,376
我正要提这个 这是他的档案
I was coming to that. This is his file.

557
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:56,316
还是政治保安处
Special Branch again.

558
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:59,320
反商业欺诈局...
Then we have the Fraud Squad...

559
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:02,517
国税局...
Inland Revenue...

560
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,760
秘密核算报告 英格兰银行汇票副本
Bank of England foreign exchange division...

561
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,282
您想看多少?
How much do you want?

562
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:12,564
这些事当时都是合法的吧?
All this was technically legal at the time, wasn't it?

563
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:17,562
对 理论上也许合法 但他就不能再当财长
Yes but it ruled him out of consideration for the Treasury.

564
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:20,605
这些都哪来的 军情五处?
How did they get all this Ml5?

565
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:25,079
这个 只能说已经卷入够深了
let's just say it's all been gone into quite enough.

566
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,283
就像那位神秘女士
Like the shady lady!

567
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:34,282
这也太劲爆了吧      问我干吗 我又没看
Isn't it all astounding? I don't know. I haven't seen it

568
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,722
汉弗莱 不要以为我笨...      哦 大臣 说哪里话
Don't think me foolish. Oh, Minister, perish the thought

569
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:46,085
对不起 杰弗里来干什么?      不能冒这个险
Geoffrey. Why are you here? We dare not allow these scandals.

570
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:50,286
丑闻抖出去 党派和国家都脸上无光
If they are, it would embarrass the country and the party

571
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,915
如果他俩之一当选的话
if either of them became head of government.

572
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:56,875
我们可不想被人光着屁股抓住      就像埃里克
We can't be caught with our trousers down. Like Eric!

573
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,365
明白了
I see.

574
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,523
确实 事态很严重
Yes, this is serious.

575
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,643
非常严重      非常严重
Very serious. Very serious.

576
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:10,244
要是他俩之一上台会怎样?      那就严重了
What happens if one them became PM? Something very serious

577
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,602
非常严重      确实
Very serious. I see.

578
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:16,801
严重的后果      严重的后果
Serious repercussions... Serious repercussions...

579
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,401
极其严重之至
...of the utmost seriousness.

580
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:22,401
对 还真是严重
Yes, that is serious.

581
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:27,561
实际上 我敢说严重到不能再严重
I would say that it could hardly be more serious.

582
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:33,323
好吧 至少我们都同意 确实挺严重
Well, I think we're all agreed, then, this is serious.

583
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:34,920
对
Yes.

584
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,282
现在怎么办?
What happens now?

585
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:40,280
党内得提出新候选人 要快
The party needs to agree on another candidate, quick.

586
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:44,884
组织秘书想问您有没有人选      作为党主席
The Chief Whip wondered if you had any ideas As Party Chairman

587
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:47,515
这可难说了
Well, it's rather difficult.

588
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:53,478
你们要找一个出类拔萃的人 做首相的料
You're looking for a potential Prime Minister.

589
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,320
他得可靠      对
Someone who's sound. Yes.

590
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,926
随和
Likeable.

591
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,525
灵活
Flexible.

592
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:04,917
对 健全
Yes. Normal.

593
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,085
有凝聚力      对
Solvent. Yes.

594
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,603
党内两翼都能接受
And acceptable to both wings of the party.

595
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,680
并且要懂得采纳意见 大臣
And someone who understands how to take advice

596
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:18,963
对 这个...
Yes. Well...

597
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,400
天呐 得推荐谁呢?
Gosh! Who can I suggest?

598
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,757
您自己想不想干?      我?
Have you thought of doing the job yourself? Me?!

599
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:31,078
怎么不行?      您不愿意当首相?
Why not? Wouldn't you want to be Prime Minister?

600
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:34,163
当然愿意 不过...责任重大啊
I'd love to be, but... It's a very big job

601
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,039
我不一定当得起 首相呀
I'm not sure I could. Prime Minister!

602
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,798
也许大臣自认为算不上国家栋梁之才
Perhaps He feels he's not Prime Ministerial calibre.

603
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,531
绝对没那回事 汉弗莱
There isn't any doubt about that, Humphrey

604
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:46,214
不不 我也不那么想 不过您在犹豫
No, not in my mind. But you seem hesitant.

605
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:49,676
做人要谦虚嘛 但我自信我能胜任
Modesty forbids. But I have no doubt I can do the job.

606
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:53,999
谦虚之至 大臣      还剩一个问题
Modestly put. There's only one fly in the ointment.

607
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,200
公众不太认识你
You're a bit of an outsider

608
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:59,327
未来几天你能不能高调打场大胜仗?
Can you organise some public success in the next few days?

609
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:03,366
有点麻烦 我正陷在欧洲香肠堆里呢
A tall order. I'm up to my neck in the Euro sausage!

610
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:09,440
不能发动宣传 让大家知道我有意参选吗?
Won't it be enough to let people know I want the job?

611
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,600
恰恰相反 最好让大家知道你绝无此意
Quite the reverse! Better to let people know you DON'T want it.

612
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:17,203
这就够了?      对 只要您跟谁都这么说
Would that be enough? If you tell everybody that, yes.

613
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:22,043
宣传我来做 您只说您完全没这个野心
Leave it to me. Say you have no ambitions in that direction.

614
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:26,485
好吧 可如果有人问"你不愿负责任吗?"
Supposing somebody says, "Do you refuse to stand?"

615
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:31,402
你知道 媒体会下套      大臣 我无权多嘴 不过
the media try to trap you. It's not my place, but

616
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:36,800
一贯的回答是 "尽管一个人不谋其位"
previously answer was "While one does not seek the office

617
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,004
"他仍以造福国家为己任"
"one has pledged oneself to the service of one's country,

618
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:44,843
"若是众望所归 唯有上台才最能造福国家"
"and if friends persuade one that was the best way to serve

619
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,996
"他也只能担起责任来"
"one might have to accept the responsibility

620
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:52,140
"完全舍弃自己的私心"
whatever one's own private wishes might be."

621
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:02,683
"舍弃私心..." 好吧 我记住了
"...private wishes might be." Yes, I think I've got that.

622
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,044
那就有三派候选人了
So, it's a three-way election, then.

623
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:10,200
若能团结一致 那是最好 公众喜欢团结
it should be an unopposed. Unity sits well with the public.

624
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,518
党内也会欢迎      埃里克和邓肯不会
The party will welcome that. Eric and Duncan won't!

625
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:16,406
埃里克和邓肯得有人劝退
Eric and Duncan must be persuaded to withdraw.

626
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,972
哦 你要找他们谈谈
Oh. You mean you'll have a word with them

627
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:23,937
我谈不了 我没看过档案
I can't. I haven't seen the files.

628
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:27,800
你呢 汉弗莱?      不行 大臣 这是党内事务
Humphrey, then. No, it's an internal party matter.

629
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:30,845
我插手不合适      那么 谁...
It would be most improper. Well, who...

630
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:34,843
你是说...?
You don't mean...?

631
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:38,158
我不行      没有别人行
I can't! No one else can.

632
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:40,862
你要我当面告诉同僚
You want me to tell one of my colleagues

633
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:43,508
他们一个是诈骗犯 一个是变态狂
he's a swindler and the other he's a pervert!

634
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:49,124
不必挑明 大臣 就说您不相信他们有错
Say you don't believe they've done anything wrong.

635
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,953
显示您掌握了情报就行
Just let them know you know something.

636
00:41:51,953 --> 00:41:53,520
他们会叫我少管闲事
They'll tell me to mind my own business!

637
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,423
就说作为党主席
Then you say, as Chairman, it's your duty

638
00:41:56,423 --> 00:41:59,578
您有责任透露信息给有关方面
to see the information reaches those who need to know.

639
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:02,500
党内执政者 主要捐助人
The Party Executive, major contributors,

640
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,957
元老 财团 皇室之类的
elder statesmen, patrons, the Palace, perhaps.

641
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:10,040
说清楚 他们别无选择 只能退出
Tell them they have no alternative but to pull out

642
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:13,244
力挺能保护他们的人
and support someone who will protect them.

643
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,319
你要我保护他们?
You want me to protect them?

644
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:20,799
他们的私事不影响国家安全 别人就无权干涉
It's nobody else's business as long as security's not involved.

645
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:25,995
我可做不来      您没选择 您都知道了
I don't have the stomach. You have no choice. you know.

646
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:30,843
别人不知道我知道 就当没这回事
Nobody else knows. Let's just forget all about it!

647
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,243
您真有魄力      魄力?为什么?
That would be very courageous. Courageous? Why?

648
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:41,118
如果将来出了事 爆出来您掩盖了内情
If later emerged you had the information and suppressed it

649
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:46,805
你要泄漏出去?      你徇私舞弊
You mean you'd leak it? Covering up for your chums...

650
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:50,960
"为救好友自毁前程 善莫大焉"(新约)
Greater love hath no man than should lay down his career.

651
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:53,402
汉弗莱 你威胁我
Humphrey, you're threatening me!

652
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,675
不 大臣 我在帮助您
No, Minister, I'm helping you.

653
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:03,685
你看 吉姆 首相还得有一项素质
You see there's one other quality Prime Ministers need.

654
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,883
杀手本能
The killer instinct.

655
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,243
杀手本能
The killer instinct.

656
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,286
对
Yes.

657
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,479
啊 谢谢
Ah, thanks.

658
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:21,119
敬10号      谢谢...我是说 好的
Well, here's to Number 10, eh? Thanks... I mean, yes.

659
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,085
什么事 吉姆?
What's up, Jim?

660
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,158
邓肯...
Duncan...

661
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:37,524
我有个问题      你不支持我了
...I have a problem. You're not going to support me.

662
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:39,757
对 不对      对 不对?
Yes. No. Yes, no?

663
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,280
正是
Exactly.

664
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,757
我得到一些信息
Some information has come my way.

665
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,885
哦 是吗?      重要信息
Oh, yes? Serious information.

666
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:54,839
关于你个人的...理财方式      你说什么?
Concerning your...financial operations. I beg your pardon?

667
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,046
大陆和通用公司的倒闭      运气不佳罢了
The collapse of Continental and General. just bad luck.

668
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:02,404
资金转移到董事长挂名的公司
The transfer of funds to directors' nominee companies.

669
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:05,877
没什么不妥当的      理论上是 不过...
There's nothing wrong with that. Technically, but...

670
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:09,926
联系到近海证券那起案子?
in conjunction with a similar case at Offshore Securities?

671
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:15,322
哪来的消息?      抱歉 可如果你要参选首相
Where did you get this? Sorry, if you're running for PM

672
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,925
我有责任把我知道的通报给党内元老
I shall share what I know with senior party members.

673
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:27,037
如果捅出去 国税局会展开调查 还有反欺诈局
there'd have to be an enquiry by Inland Revenue,Fraud Squad

674
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,636
当然那也没关系 你说全是光明正大的
None of that need matter if it's all above-board.

675
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:35,924
我相信 你说是就是 邓肯
And I'm sure it is, if you say so, Duncan.

676
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:44,406
没什么不合适      好 那我去告诉他们
There was nothing improper. Good, then I'm free to talk about it,

677
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,639
全都公布出来      且慢
bring it all out into the open. Hold on!

678
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:51,641
经济事务容易被曲解 人们会误会
Financial matters can be misinterpreted.

679
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,399
可不是
How true.

680
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:57,845
好吧 吉姆 我不一定非要进10号
Look, Jim, I'm not sure that I really want Number 10.

681
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:04,282
外交部也有很多好处 但我不会支持埃里克
Foreign Office is a better job. But I won't support Eric.

682
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:08,155
如果埃里克也选不上呢?
Suppose Eric didn't get it?

683
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:14,837
你愿不愿意转而支持另一个人?
How about transfer all your support to someone else?

684
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,326
谁?
Who?

685
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:20,002
这人必须赏识你的品质
It would have to be somebody who recognised your qualities,

686
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,886
想要你继续执掌外交部
who'd want you to stay at the Foreign Office.

687
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:26,642
知道小心对待大陆和通用公司
Someone who could be discreet about Continental and General.

688
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:30,001
你信得过的人
Someone you could trust.

689
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:32,877
一位老朋友
An old friend.

690
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,236
你说你自己?
Do you mean you?

691
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:43,525
我吗?我可没有这方面的野心
Me? I have absolutely no ambition in that direction.

692
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,882
还真是说你
You DO mean you!

693
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,438
我明白了      你知道这很严重吧 埃里克?
I see. You do realise this is serious, Eric?

694
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,997
是 你不打算帮我是吗?      是
Yes. And you're not going to help me, right? Yes.

695
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,283
帮还是不帮?      是
You are or you're not? Yes.

696
00:45:57,447 --> 00:46:01,963
吉姆      我会帮你 但不是帮你竞选
Jim! I'm going to help you, but not to become PM.

697
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:07,042
你答应好的      那时我不知道阿根廷那位女士
You said you were. Until I heard about the lady from Argentina.

698
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,525
和其它人      明白了
And others. I see.

699
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:13,601
作为主席 我有我的职责
As Party Chairman I have my duty.

700
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:18,557
如果你当上首相 消息捅出去 全党都要遭殃
It'd be a disaster if you became PM and all this came out.

701
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:22,800
我可不想对女王陛下解释
I wouldn't care to have to explain it to Her Majesty.

702
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,798
你呢?
Would you?

703
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:27,957
我退出
I'll withdraw.

704
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,561
这非常明智
I think that's very sensible.

705
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,439
我们再不对任何人提这些事
So we'll say no more about it to anyone.

706
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:36,359
谢谢 吉姆
Thanks, Jim.

707
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:41,555
那邓肯要进10号了 老天爷      我可不允许
So Duncan will get Number 10. Not if I can help it.

708
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:44,525
那会是谁?      干杯
Who, then? Cheers.

709
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:49,644
你说你自己?      我吗?
You don't mean YOU? Me?

710
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:55,643
孩子长大了 安妮和我都想多花些时间在一起
Annie and I are hoping to spend more time together.

711
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:57,684
还真是说你
You DO mean you!

712
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,961
大臣      汉弗莱 什么事这么急?
Minister. Humphrey, what's the hurry?

713
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:06,119
真抱歉 我请了欧洲专使来开个小会
I've arranged a meeting with the European Commissioner.

714
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:08,118
莫里斯?他早上才坐飞机离开
Maurice? He flew out this morning.

715
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,676
他的航班延迟了      怎么?
His flight's been delayed. So?

716
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,522
也许能说服他为我们解决香肠问题
We might persuade him to solve our sausage problem.

717
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,678
汉弗莱 怎么解决?
How? (PHONE RINGS)

718
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:19,281
抱歉...喂?
Excuse me... Yes?

719
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:22,837
好的 请他进来 谢谢
Oh, yes, ask him to come in, will you? Thank you.

720
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,560
交给我办
Leave it to me.

721
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,363
只要...我让您帮腔就帮腔
Just, er, just give me support when I ask for it.

722
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:35,359
啊 莫里斯 幸会幸会      汉弗莱
Ah, Maurice, how nice to see you. Humphrey.

723
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:39,486
你们认识      吉姆 叫我来有何贵干?
You know each other. Jim, to what do I owe this pleasure?

724
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:45,444
大臣要我安排这次会面
The Minister asked me to arrange this meeting

725
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:48,963
请你帮忙解决个问题      问题
to see if you could help us with a problem. Problem.

726
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,480
当然
Of course.

727
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:55,198
问题是 欧共体在我国日渐不受欢迎
The problem is EEC is becoming unpopular over here.

728
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,437
对吧 大臣?      很不受欢迎
Isn't that so? Very unpopular.

729
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,643
你要重振它的声誉?      对
You want to restore its image? Yes.

730
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:01,445
不对      不对
No. No.

731
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:05,997
问题在于 大臣为了更多选票...
The Minister feels there would be more votes...

732
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:09,603
为了代表广大英国民众的意见
He would be better expressing the views of the British

733
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:14,443
他得与大家一道谴责欧共体 不能维护它
by joining the attack than leaping to its defence.

734
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:18,361
没错      但你们政府承诺支持我们
Exactly. But your party's committed to support us!

735
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,723
大臣的观点 据我所知
The Minister's point, as I understand it,

736
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:27,402
是政府支持它的概念和公约
is that the commitment is to the concept and the treaty.

737
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,525
公约      而不是支持这一机构
Treaty. It's not committed to the institutions,

738
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,599
也不支持其行动 或是个别政策
nor to the practices, nor to individual policies.

739
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:38,602
大臣曾向我提到一个例子 是吗 大臣?
The Minister was giving me an example the other day.

740
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,397
关于粮食生产      哦 对
About food production. Oh, yes.

741
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:49,561
我发现你们有个官员雇佣农民生产过剩粮食
One of your officials pays farmers to produce surplus food

742
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:53,037
隔壁又有个官员雇人销毁它们
while the next office pays people to destroy the surpluses.

743
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:55,767
没那事      没有?
That's not true! No?

744
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:58,805
绝不是隔壁 根本不在同一个楼层
It's not the next office, not even the same floor!

745
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:04,439
大臣还有几百个这种例子      几百个
The Minister has hundreds of similar examples. Hundreds.

746
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:09,965
问题在于 大臣觉得内阁里
The Minister is starting to think that a member of the Cabinet

747
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:13,358
应该有人告诉英国人民
ought to start telling the British people about them.

748
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:16,041
那怎么可以
But that would be intolerable!

749
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:19,005
意大利人都忍受不了
Even the Italians wouldn't stoop that low!

750
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:25,322
意大利人又不用管自家香肠叫"乳化高脂杂碎筒"
Italians aren't redesignate salami as high-fat offal tubing.

751
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:32,716
你们打算怎样?
And what are you proposing?

752
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:37,756
话说回来 要统一市场 也不能叫它香肠啊
we are committed to harmonisation. We cannot call it sausage.

753
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:40,236
你们有何建议?
What do you suggest?

754
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:43,806
政治是表述的艺术
Well, politics is about presentation.

755
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,198
为什么不叫它"英国肠"?
Why don't we call it "the British sausage"?

756
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:50,884
英国肠? Saucisse Anglaise(法语)
British sausage? Saucisse Anglaise.

757
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:54,437
Salsiccia Inglese(意语) Britisherwurst(德语)
Salsiccia Inglese. Britisherwurst.

758
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:59,237
对 我们可以...提请委员会批准
Yes, I think we could... recommend that to the Commission.

759
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:00,726
太好了
Splendid!

760
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:05,119
大臣一向认为欧共体是一家卓越的机构 对吧?
The Minister's always said the EEC is a splendid institution.

761
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:06,766
太卓越了
Splendid!

762
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:16,600
欧洲线记者到了      好的 都请进来
The European correspondents are here now. Good. Let 'em in.

763
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,519
不请进来吗?
Send them in.

764
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:22,760
要谈欧洲香肠问题吗?      是的 伯纳
This is about the Euro sausage problem? That's right, Bernard.

765
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:25,760
宣布您解决了?      不 伯纳
That you've solved it. No, Bernard.

766
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:29,840
解决问题不叫新闻 对媒体来说 噩耗才是喜讯
Solved problems aren't news. Bad news is good news.

767
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:34,444
我不会让他们无聊 我今天给他们一场灾难
I'm not give them a non-story. I'll give a disaster today

768
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:37,405
明天再来力挽狂澜      是这样啊
and a triumph tomorrow. I see.

769
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:40,641
早安 先生们      早安
Good morning, gentlemen! (ALL) Morning.

770
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:43,640
请坐 感谢大家前来
Do sit down. Good of you to come.

771
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,219
这件事还在协商中 没有定案
This is on a lobby basis, non-attributable.

772
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:49,159
但我们和欧共体有些分歧
We've got some trouble coming up with Brussels.

773
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:54,676
早晚有人会说 所以我不如主动通报出来
Somebody's going to tell you so I might as well tell you myself.

774
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,285
问题是 布鲁塞尔要宣布英国香肠非法
Brussels is about to make the British sausage illegal

775
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:03,200
不合欧共体条例      大臣
under EEC regulations. Minister...

776
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:05,932
不是香肠非法 只是名字
...not making the sausage illegal, just the name

777
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:07,942
谢谢 伯纳 我会提到的
Thank you, Bernard. I'll deal with that later.

778
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:12,278
什么叫"非法"?      不合法律规定
What do you mean, "illegal"? Effectively illegal.

779
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:17,840
猪肉肠必须含有75%瘦猪肉 牛肉肠也一样
pork sausage will contain 75% pork. The same for beef sausage.

780
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:23,685
也是75%瘦猪肉?
75% lean pork too?

781
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,721
75%瘦牛肉
75% lean beef.

782
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:30,721
将它们打入奢侈品范畴      什么时候会宣布?
make it a luxury food. When's this being promulgated?

783
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,096
大概下个月 眼下他们会否认
Next month, probably. They'll deny it

784
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:36,762
会说只不过改个名字
tell you they're just discussing changing its name.

785
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:40,882
政府打算怎么办?      我真不知道
What is the government going to do? I just don't know.

786
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:43,845
事态严重 我不想假装已经有了解决方案
It's a big problem. I won't pretend we've got an answer.

787
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:48,000
我还有别的事 有问题吗?
Well, I must rush. Any more questions?

788
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,398
什么时候能登报?      据我所知 明天吧
When can we use this? Tomorrow, as far as I'm concerned.

789
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,845
伯纳会请你们去宣传办喝一杯 谢谢光临
Bernard will give you a drink in the press office.

790
00:51:56,887 --> 00:52:00,880
大臣 您知道媒体将发布假消息吧?
You realise the press will print something isn't true?

791
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,446
是吗?
Really?

792
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:05,124
真可怕
How frightful!

793
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:12,403
今天关于欧洲封杀英国香肠的消息
Today's story about the European ban on the British sausage

794
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:15,127
在政坛上引起轩然大波
<i>has caused a maj'or political storm.</i>

795
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:18,996
议会称香肠会成为又一块香蕉皮
<i>Westminster say the sausage could be another banana skin.</i>

796
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:22,398
为政府的稳步发展增添了新的考验
Adds to the government's problems with the succession

797
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:27,277
议员们不知所措 两大候选人
<i>The two obvious candidates for the leadership</i>

798
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,245
代表了党内两翼的极端
<i>represent the extreme wings of the party.</i>

799
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,195
不断有人施加压力 要求他们退出
<i>Pressure is mounting for them to withdraw </i>

800
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:34,367
另寻折衷的候选人
in favour of a compromise candidate.

801
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:39,363
但尚未有新竞争者出现在公众视野中
<i>No other contender seems to have caught the public imagination.</i>

802
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:42,166
体育方面      关掉吧 唐纳德
<i>Now sport... Turn it off, Donald.</i>

803
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:48,717
真的吗 折衷候选人的事?      恐怕是的
Is it true about the compromise candidate? I believe so.

804
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:53,244
他们哪来的消息?      我可猜不到 伯纳
Where DO they get their information? I can't imagine, Bernard!

805
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:56,604
反正我没说折衷 只说了缓和
Anyway, I never said compromise. I said moderate.

806
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,902
再说 大臣 为什么今晚BBC
Incidentally, why are BBC TV

807
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:02,981
和独立电视台要报导您的演讲?
and ITN covering your speech this evening?

808
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:04,838
我可不知道 伯纳
I can't imagine, Bernard.

809
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:10,639
我知道政府大楼防火保安措施很重要 可是...
I know fire policy in government is important but...

810
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:15,164
也许有人暗示我还要讲其它内容
Someone suggested I was going to raise other issues as well.

811
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:19,282
是谁?      我可猜不到 伯纳
Who? I can't imagine, Bernard.

812
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:26,279
我是个好欧洲人 我相信大欧洲理念
I am a good European. I believe in the European ideal.

813
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:31,282
两次世界大战的流血惨案决不能重演
Never again shall we repeat the bloodshed of the two world wars.

814
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:34,007
大欧洲永不会退缩
Europe is here to stay.

815
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:39,241
但我们同样不会屈从每项指令
we don't have to bow the knee to every directive

816
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:42,717
出自布鲁塞尔每个刚愎自用的小官僚
from every little bureaucratic Bonaparte in Brussels.

817
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,763
主权神圣不可侵犯
We are a sovereign nation still.

818
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,998
我们是英国人 我们为此自豪
We are British and proud of it!

819
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:55,484
我们已经太迁就那些欧洲农业政委
We made enough concessions to the Commissar for Agriculture.

820
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:59,196
我用政委这个词 并不是无心的
When I say Commissar, I use the word advisedly.

821
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,643
我们吞下了红酒湖和黄油山
We've swallowed the wine lake and the butter mountain,

822
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:06,561
眼看着法国朋友们打退英国卡车司机
we've watched our French friends beating up British drivers

823
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,036
禁止优质英国羊肉运到法国
carrying British lamb to the French.

824
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:12,438
我们已经卑躬屈膝 拱手而降
We have bowed and scraped, doffed our caps,

825
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:17,635
点头哈腰 顶礼膜拜 但我说 够了就是够了
Turned the other cheek, but I say enough is enough!

826
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:25,402
欧洲已经走得太远 他们威胁到了英国香肠
The Europeans are now threatening the British sausage.

827
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:26,838
他们明里说要标准化
They want to standardise it

828
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:31,321
暗里却在逼我们接受意大利和德国肠
they'll force us to eat salami and bratwurst

829
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:33,785
还有其它油腻的蒜味外国货
and other garlic-ridden greasy foods that are

830
00:54:33,785 --> 00:54:36,733
与英式生活格格不入
totally alien to the British way of life.

831
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:39,314
你们早餐想吃意大利肠火腿蛋吗?
Do you want salami for breakfast with your egg and bacon?

832
00:54:39,314 --> 00:54:41,438
我不想 我绝不同意
I don't! I won't!

833
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:49,003
他们把品脱转换成公升 英码转换成公尺
They've turned our pints into litres and our yards into metres.

834
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:51,698
我们放弃了六便士 三便士
We gave up the tanner, the threepenny bit

835
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,567
两先令和半克朗银币
the two-bob piece and the half crown,

836
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:57,276
但他们不能 也不会摧毁英国香肠
but they cannot and WILL not destroy the British sausage.

837
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,804
只要我还在这里
Not while I'm here!

838
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:09,600
正如马丁路德所说 "我立场如此 再无二话"
In the words of Martin Luther, here I stand. I can do no more.

839
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:18,802
很强硬啊 大臣     我强烈地感受到这些
Strong stuff, Minister. I feel strongly about it.

840
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,922
有时我怀疑你们做媒体的
I sometimes wonder whether you media people

841
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:23,832
能否体验我们其它人
realise how strongly we others feel

842
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:26,350
对英国 对我们祖国的强烈感受
about Britain, about our country.

843
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,760
我们爱它 为它而自豪
We love it and we're proud of it.

844
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,879
您不同意政府对欧共体的政策?
You're at odds with government policy over the EEC?

845
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:34,357
我很满意政府的政策 路德维克爵士
I'm very happy with government policy, Sir Ludovic.

846
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:40,284
政府可从未出台政策 封杀英国香肠
But it's never been policy to abolish the British sausage.

847
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:44,565
香肠不止好吃而已 它还营养丰富
Sausages are full of top-quality nourishment.

848
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:48,402
可是大臣 欧共体否认要封杀英国香肠
Brussels denies wanting to abolish the British sausage.

849
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:50,619
当然 他们知道阻力多大
They would. They know what they're up against

850
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:53,038
他们知道英国民意的力量
They know the strength of British opinion.

851
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:56,644
您的演讲被媒体广为传颂
Your speech got a lot of coverage and a lot of praise.

852
00:55:56,807 --> 00:56:00,402
您是特意选择这一时机吗?      什么?
Was there any significance in the timing? Sorry?

853
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:05,516
贵党正在寻找新领导人 您的名字也略有提起
Your party is looking for leader, your name's been mentioned

854
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:08,440
哦 提的人还不少
Oh. Quite a lot, I believe.

855
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,439
可是没有 我从没有这方面的野心
But no, I've no ambitions at all in that direction.

856
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:15,485
那您肯定不会参选了?
So you definitely won't let your name go forward?

857
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,962
这个嘛 阿路...我向来...
Well, Ludo... All I've...

858
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:25,763
我向来以造福国家为己任 从不在乎岗位
All I wanted to do is serve my country, never sought office.

859
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,098
但如果同僚们说服我
But if my colleagues persuaded me

860
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:31,448
进入10号才最能造福国家
the best place to serve it from was 10 Downing Street,

861
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:35,837
我也只能勉为其难 担起责任来
I reluctantly be persuaded to undertake the responsibility

862
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,885
完全舍弃我的私心
whatever my own private wishes might be.

863
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:42,403
既然不参选 您会投票给谁?
If you're not in the running, who will you vote for?

864
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,276
现在还为时过早 但我要说
Well, it's far too early to say. But I will say this.

865
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,802
这是治愈的时代
This is a time for healing.

866
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:55,122
时代要求我们着眼于共识 求同存异
A time to stress what we agree about

867
00:56:55,287 --> 00:57:00,680
要看到对手好的一面 不能一味挑错
We should be looking for the good in our opponents

868
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:03,964
你知道 人人皆有优点 阿路
There's good in everyone, you know, Ludo.

869
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:07,926
除了法国人      除了...
Except the French! Except...

870
00:57:12,047 --> 00:57:14,038
甚至包括法国人
Even the French.

871
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:25,565
大臣 您在内阁的时候议会传来消息
A message came from House while you were in committee.

872
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,046
怎么?
Yes?

873
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:28,934
他们把党员大会提前了
They brought the party meeting forward.

874
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,754
一小时前就开始了      提前了?
Brought it forward?

875
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:36,924
他们随时会决定是否再提出一人与您对垒
They'll decide if they're going to bring up another candidate

876
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,674
出决议了组织秘书会打电话来
The Chief Whip will phone as soon as it's over.

877
00:57:39,674 --> 00:57:42,949
他会不会...他们...要是...
W-W-Will he... W-What will they... What if...

878
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:45,836
哪个电话?
Which phone?

879
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,043
什么?      他会打哪个电话?
What? Which phone will he ring on?

880
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:50,767
哦 大概是这个
Oh. Er, this one, probably.

881
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,405
或者这个
Or this one.

882
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,326
都可能 真的
Either, really.

883
00:57:56,487 --> 00:57:59,273
就算邓肯和埃里克真的退出
If Duncan and Eric withdraw, which they will,

884
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:00,430
他们也不一定支持我
they might not support me.

885
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,567
那就要普选了
That means an election.

886
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:04,885
没错 可您是双方最看好的候选人
You're the favourite candidate for both sides,

887
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,205
不会反对您的      他们是这么说
so you'll be unopposed. That's what they say.

888
00:58:09,407 --> 00:58:12,160
算了 急也没用
Oh, well... No point in worrying about it.

889
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:17,282
还是坐下歇歇气
Might as well sit down and relax. (PHONE RINGS)

890
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:20,440
喂?
Yes?

891
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:23,440

好的
Yes.

894
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:33,081
伯纳有急事找您
Bernard has an urgent message.

895

大臣 王宫打来电话
Minister, the Palace have been on the phone.

896
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:40,999

Will you be free to kiss hands at five o'clock?

897
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,886
如果没有第二名候选人的话
In the event of an unopposed recommendation.

898
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:45,366
这个 我...
Well, I...

899

我想应该没问题
I think I might be able to make that.

900
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:02,364
伯纳
Bernard...

901
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,041
如果...要是我...
Supposing... You know if I...

902
00:59:08,247 --> 00:59:11,000
我还得要个首席私人秘书
I'd still want a Principal Private Secretary.

903
00:59:12,487 --> 00:59:15,365
你觉得你...      哦 大臣
Do you think, er... Oh, Minister.

904
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:17,800
天呐
Gosh!

905

可以的吧 汉弗莱?      这个
That'll be all right, won't it, Humphrey? Well...

906
