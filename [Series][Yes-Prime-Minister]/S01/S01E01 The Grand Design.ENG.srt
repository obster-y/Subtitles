1
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:17,137
Tell me, General. Where's the hotline?

2
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,777
- Which one?
- The one to Russia.

3
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,019
The red hotline, sir.

4
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,339
It's in Downing Street.

5
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,819
- I can get through to the Soviet president?
- Theoretically, yes.

6
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,981
- Theoretically?
- That's what we tell journalists.

7
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:35,540
We did once get through to the Kremlin,
but only to a switchboard operator.

8
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,499
- Couldn't the operator put you through?
- Never found out. Didn't speak much English.

9
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:43,137
- How often is it tested?
- Not too often.

10
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:45,823
It creates unnecessary panic at the other end,

11
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,460
and panic is a good thing to avoid
where nuclear weapons are concerned.

12
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,382
- Yes.
- Now, this is it.

13
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,580
Ah, good.

14
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,344
- What is it?
- The trigger, Prime Minister.

15
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,023
- The trigger?
- The nuclear trigger, the button.

16
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,623
- This?
- Indirectly, yes.

17
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,539
This is the telex communication
with HMS Northwood.

18
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,147
You send a coded signal and Northwood's
telex operator sends an authentication signal.

19
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,340
So he knows it's from you.

20
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,063
When the instruction's been authenticated,

21
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:24,222
Northwood sends a command to a Polaris
submarine and they press the button.

22
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,818
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

23
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,503
- When I say so?
- When you say so.

24
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,538
Wouldn't anybody argue with me?

25
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:36,148
Serving officers obey orders without question.

26
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:38,664
What if I were to get drunk?

27
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,026
On the whole, it would be safer if you didn't.

28
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,588
Blimey!

29
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:46,741
It's your job and you wanted it, Prime Minister.

30
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,697
- Supposing I were to go off my rocker?
- The Cabinet might notice.

31
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:55,659
I wouldn't count on it. Seriously,
supposing I did and then changed my mind?

32
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,986
That's all right.
No one would ever know, would they?

33
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:06,418
- How many bombs are there?
- Four Polaris submarines, 16 missiles on each.

34
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,541
- But how many actual bombs?
- 192.

35
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:13,583
Each one at least five times the power
of the Hiroshima bomb.

36
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,144
You're thinking, ''Not very many.''

37
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,147
I don't know. That seems enough.

38
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,103
Not with 1200 Soviet missiles
trained on Britain, waiting to retaliate.

39
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:25,504
- 1200?
- Hmm.

40
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,901
Britain's always fought against the odds -
the Armada, Battle of Britain.

41
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,466
Yes, and we'll have a great deal
more firepower when we get Trident.

42
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,097
Thank goodness for conventional forces!

43
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,545
They would hold the Russians for at most 72 hours.

44
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:42,740
- Is that all?
- Hmm.

45
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:46,379
So in an emergency,
I would have to make an instant decision?

46
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:49,581
- No, you'd probably have 12 hours.
- 12 hours?

47
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:52,104
Shouldn't we do something about this?

48
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:56,825
Yes, but for 20 years, politicians have said
they can't afford the conventional forces.

49
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,021
Conventional forces are very expensive,
Prime Minister.

50
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,657
Much cheaper just to press a button.

51
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,423
So how long should we allow for this meeting?

52
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,659
- 72 hours...
- Fine.

53
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,263
It's only the New Zealand High Commissioner.

54
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:18,104
Isn't 72 hours a bit generous?

55
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,419
I was just thinking
how long we could hold the Russians.

56
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,582
If we persuaded the Americans
to strengthen THEIR conventional forces...

57
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,257
I don't think it'll make much difference.

58
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,626
The American troops in Germany
are all so drug-ridden,

59
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,303
they don't know which side they're on anyway.

60
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,903
And during the last NATO exercises,

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,460
the U.S. troops dispersed and picnicked
in the woods with lady soldiers.

62
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,938
- What about the other NATO armies?
- They're all right. On weekdays, anyway.

63
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,662
Weekdays?

64
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,344
The Dutch, Danish and Belgian armies
go home for the weekend.

65
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,663
So if the Russians are to invade, we'd prefer them
to do it between Mondays and Fridays?

66
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:03,822
- Is this widely known?
- If I know it, I'm sure the Russians do.

67
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:08,824
The Kremlin usually gets NATO information
before it filters through to Number 10.

68
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:13,420
- So it comes back to Trident?
- When it comes.

69
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,057
- If it works.
- If it wor...

70
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,702
- What do you mean?
- Normally, when new weapons are delivered,

71
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,861
the warheads don't fit the ends of the rockets.

72
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,663
That's what happened to Polaris. You know
the sort of thing, wiring faults, microchip failure.

73
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,381
We couldn't fire Polaris for some years.
Cruise is probably the same. Trident might be too.

74
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:39,023
We should take the manufacturers to court.

75
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,699
We can't risk the publicity -
security and they know it!

76
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:46,657
- We should change the manufacturers.
- We do all the time.

77
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:51,983
The manufacturers know that too. That's why
that torpedo landed on Sandwich golf course.

78
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:56,984
Sandwich golf course?
I didn't read that in the papers.

79
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,657
Of course not. There was a cover-up.

80
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:04,345
The members just found a new bunker
on the 7th fairway the next morning.

81
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:10,263
- So the torpedoes don't work either?
- No, only the new ones. The others are fine.

82
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,986
The ones designed during the Second World War.

83
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,181
- Over 40 years ago?
- They had lots of testing.

84
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,546
- You can't afford that with the modern ones.
- Why not?

85
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,829
Well, if there's a nuclear war, it won't last
long enough for the weapons to be tested.

86
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,544
Are there other things I don't know
about the UK's defence?

87
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:34,186
I don't know, Prime Minister.
I don't know what you don't know.

88
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,622
The government's chief scientific adviser
sees the problem differently from the MoD.

89
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,265
- I'd like to see him now.
- A late drink might be wiser.

90
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,897
Better not to let the Cabinet Office know.

91
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,505
Sir Humphrey gets upset.
He doesn't regard him as one of us.

92
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,348
I thought he won the DSO at Arnhem.

93
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,979
That doesn't make up
for speaking with an Austrian accent.

94
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,028
He didn't go to Oxford or Cambridge.
He didn't even go to the LSE.

95
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,466
Prime Minister,
you believe in the nuclear deterrent?

96
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,660
- Oh, yes.
- Why?

97
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,740
- Pardon?
- Why?

98
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,065
Because it deters.

99
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,940
- Whom?
- Pardon?

100
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:20,421
- Whom? Whom does it deter?
- The Russians from attacking us.

101
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,142
- Why?
- Pardon?

102
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,628
Why?

103
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,020
They know if they launched an attack,
I'd press the button.

104
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,697
- You would?
- Well, wouldn't I?

105
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,860
Well, would you?

106
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:34,543
At the last resort, yes, I certainly would.

107
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,348
Well, I think I certainly would. Yes.

108
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,900
- And what is the last resort?
- If the Russians invaded western Europe.

109
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:48,103
You only have 12 hours to decide, so you're
saying the last resort is the first response?

110
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,146
Am I?

111
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,218
You don't need to worry. Why should
the Russians annex the whole of Europe?

112
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,857
They can't even control Afghanistan.

113
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,984
No, if they try anything,
it will be salami tactics.

114
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,657
- Salami tactics?
- Slice by slice.

115
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,898
One small piece at a time.

116
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,425
So will you press the button
if they invade West Berlin?

117
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,987
- It all depends.
- On what?

118
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,180
Scenario one.

119
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,257
Riots in West Berlin,

120
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,624
buildings in flames.

121
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,022
East German fire brigade crosses the border
to help. Would you press the button...?

122
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,622
The East German police come with them.
The button...?

123
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,822
Then some troops,
more troops just for riot control, they say.

124
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,064
And then the East German troops
are replaced by Russian troops. Button...?

125
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,337
Then the Russian troops don't go.

126
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,297
They are invited to stay
to support civilian administration.

127
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:53,462
The civilian administration closes roads
and Tempelhof Airport.

128
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:57,579
- Now you press the button?
- I need time to think about it.

129
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,138
- You have 12 hours.
- Have I?

130
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,506
- You're inventing this.
- You are Prime Minister today.

131
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,388
The phone might ring now from NATO HQ.

132
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,819
(PHONE RINGS)

133
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:13,388
Hello...? Yes. NATO HQ, Prime Minister.

134
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,501
Can you address their annual conference in April?

135
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:22,183
I thought I could. I'm not so sure now.

136
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:24,101
Yes.

137
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,300
Scenario two.

138
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:30,985
The Russian army accidentally on purpose
cross the West German frontier.

139
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,538
- Is that the last resort?
- No.

140
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,859
Right, scenario three.

141
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,342
Suppose the Russians have invaded
West Germany, Belgium, Holland, France?

142
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,503
Suppose their tanks and troops have reached
the English Channel and are poised to invade?

143
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,864
- Is that the last resort?
- No.

144
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,542
Why not?

145
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,100
We'd only fight a nuclear war to defend ourselves.
That would be committing suicide!

146
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:58,187
So what is the last resort? Piccadilly?

147
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:01,743
Watford Gap service station?

148
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,979
The Reform Club?

149
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,659
- Maybe the nuclear deterrent makes no sense.
- Yes, it does.

150
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,822
If the Russians or Americans
have the bomb, so must the other side.

151
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:15,026
- And keep Polaris just in case.
- What are you proposing?

152
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:20,747
Cancel Trident. Spend the ?5 billion
you save on conventional forces.

153
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,982
- You wouldn't really press the button.
- I might if I had no choice.

154
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:30,547
They'll never put you in a situation where you
have no choice. They'll stick to salami tactics.

155
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,743
Supposing we cancel Trident and channel
?5 billion into conventional forces?

156
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:39,743
- What do we spend it on? Tanks?
- No, we spend it on E.T.

157
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,423
Extra-terrestrials?

158
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,745
Emergent technology.

159
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,223
- What's that?
- Smart missiles, target finding, infrared.

160
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,268
- Who would operate this E.T?
- A large conventional army.

161
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,460
A large convention...

162
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,699
I've got an idea.

163
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,420
Wait a minute!

164
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,343
I think I can see how to do this.
First, we cancel Trident.

165
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,023
- Yes.
- We don't buy Cruise either.

166
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,181
- Yes.
- Then we introduce conscription.

167
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,668
Yes.

168
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,698
Not only do we solve our defence problems,
we solve our unemployment problems as well.

169
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,423
Isn't conscription a courageous policy?

170
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,097
Courageous? Oh, my God, is it?

171
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,506
No, no.
In times of full employment, it would be.

172
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,497
But now we'd just give
unemployed young people something to do.

173
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,662
We'd teach them trades and skills.
We might even teach them to read.

174
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,300
The army never discharged anyone
who was illiterate. We could make them wash.

175
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:49,463
We'd give them a comprehensive education
to make up for their comprehensive education.

176
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:56,703
Call it ''national service''. Send the young
people out into the community services.

177
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:02,387
With one policy, we solve our defence,
educational and unemployment problems.

178
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,387
This is wonderful. I see it all now.

179
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,337
''A new deal for Britain - Hacker's Grand Design.''

180
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,261
From time to time in our great island story,

181
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,863
it falls to one man...

182
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,461
to lead his people out of the valley of the shadow

183
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,985
and into the sunlit uplands
of peace and prosperity.

184
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:29,103
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- Because we only just met.

185
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,500
Hello, darling!

186
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,577
- What's for lunch?
- You tell me.

187
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,422
- Are you going somewhere?
- Voluntary services committee. I did tell you.

188
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,379
Oh, yes, of course. I just thought
a few scrambled eggs or something.

189
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,017
I think there's some eggs in the fridge.

190
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,341
- You want me to do it?
- We agreed that I'd carry on with my work.

191
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,024
- Yes, of course.
- Foreign Office telegrams, Prime Minister.

192
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:03,977
- Put them over there.
- It's bad enough living in this goldfish bowl.

193
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:09,223
Every time I want to go out, I have to walk past
a dozen journalists and 50 gawping tourists!

194
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,381
- There's no privacy anywhere.
- That's not true.

195
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,667
(KNOCKS) Sorry, Prime Minister.
Security check. Can I just look around?

196
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,184
- Yes, carry on.
- Privacy?

197
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:23,627
- You can always walk in the garden.
- With about 60 people staring at you!

198
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,943
It's like exercising in a prison yard. And we
pay rent for this place. They should pay US!

199
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,101
- At least it's quiet.
- (BRASS BAND PLAYS)

200
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,784
- Usually.
- That's been going on since half past seven!

201
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,981
- They've got to practise somewhere.
- Why here?

202
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,779
- That's the Horse Guards' Parade.
- All clear, Prime Minister.

203
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:48,744
Annie, you must realise that a career
in public service involves some sacrifice.

204
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,622
Fine, you sacrifice your lunch. I'm late.

205
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,618
- I'm hungry!
- Aw!

206
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,706
- What did you have for YOUR lunch?
- Half a Yorkie bar.

207
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,419
Where's the other half?

208
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,780
Ah, Bernard!

209
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:10,981
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Had a good lunch?

210
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,709
- Oh, quite good.
- Where did you have it?

211
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,298
- In the Cabinet mess.
- Three courses?

212
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,306
Er, yes.

213
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:21,222
- Wine?
- A glass of claret, yes.

214
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:24,981
Would you like to know what I had for my lunch?

215
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,738
- Do you want to tell me, Prime Minister?
- Nothing!

216
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,940
Are you dieting?

217
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,141
It seems there are facilities for feeding you
and all the private secretaries,

218
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,099
the Cabinet Office, the Press Office, the
messengers, but not for me - and I live here!

219
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,466
- Can't Mrs Hacker cook for you?
- She's out at work.

220
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:47,302
- We'll get you a cook.
- Who'll pay for it?

221
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,744
- You will.
- How much?

222
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,628
- 8,000 to 10,000 a year.
- I can't afford that!

223
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,946
- Talk to the Cabinet Secretary.
- Bring him here now.

224
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:00,102
He's due here any minute. Shall we press on
with the affairs of the nation?

225
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,619
Stuff the affairs of the nation. I want a cook!

226
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:07,822
I'll look into it. Malcolm Warren
from the Press Office would like a word.

227
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,980
OK, bring him in.

228
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,344
- Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
- Good afternoon, Malcolm.

229
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,943
Could we keep this brief?

230
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:22,307
Yes, two things. First, we'll discuss
your first appearance on TV as Prime Minister.

231
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,424
Perhaps we ought to leave it until we've time
to do it thoroughly. What's the other thing?

232
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,666
- Your official visit to Washington.
- What about it?

233
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,542
- A lot of press want to come.
- Let them.

234
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,223
- It'll be very expensive.
- Malcolm!

235
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:41,543
I shall be standing on the White House lawn
side by side with the President of the USA.

236
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:45,705
National anthems, two world leaders together.

237
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,258
We will tell the world
about our happy relationship,

238
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,420
our unity, resolve,

239
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:56,582
a few words perhaps about my own courage,
wisdom, statesmanship.

240
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:01,379
Can't you realise how important this is to me?
Well, not to me, to Britain.

241
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:05,625
Our place in the world,
my place in the history books.

242
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,583
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Come in, Humphrey. Thank you, Malcolm.

243
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,104
- Malcolm...
- Humphrey!

244
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,064
- I've been thinking...
- Good.

245
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,898
I've been Prime Minister
for, let me see, three days now.

246
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,021
And a very good PM you are, too!

247
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:29,778
I'm not fishing for compliments,
though it has been going well.

248
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,065
Oh, indeed.

249
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:37,059
It's nice to be able to reward one's old allies.
Was Ron Jones pleased with his peerage?

250
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,739
Yes, Prime Minister.
He said his members would be delighted.

251
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:44,538
- His members?
- Of his union. The National Federation...

252
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:47,980
I didn't mean him. I meant our backbencher!

253
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,786
I meant to give a peerage to Ron Jones,
not Ron Jones!

254
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,021
Bloody hell!

255
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:59,107
If it's any consolation, he was awfully pleased.

256
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:04,099
I bet he was! What are we going to do
about Ron Jones's peerage? Give him one too?

257
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,700
Prime Minister, we can't send
two Lord Ron Jones to the upper house.

258
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,099
It'll look like a job lot.

259
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,262
- I've got to give him something.
- Does he watch television?

260
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:20,587
- He hasn't even got a set.
- Fine. Make him a governor of the BBC.

261
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,303
- Anything else?
- Yes, one small thing.

262
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:28,257
- I need a cook/housekeeper for the flat.
- You can advertise.

263
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,217
- No, a government cook/housekeeper.
- That could be difficult.

264
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,897
- Why?
- It's a private home.

265
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:38,897
I just want somebody to cook my lunch.
It's not unreasonable.

266
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,225
No, it's just not possible.

267
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:44,620
I can blow up the world,
but not ask for scrambled eggs?

268
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:49,061
- You can ASK for them.
- What if I asked the German ambassador?

269
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,261
That's OK - official engagement,
government hospitality.

270
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,466
We'll provide a seven-course meal
with wine and brandy.

271
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,457
The German ambassador's lunch
is government business, but mine isn't?

272
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:01,699
That is so. Any ambassador's.

273
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:06,903
Fine. Bernard, get the diary. On Monday,
I'll have lunch with the German ambassador.

274
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:12,063
On Tuesday, with the French ambassador;
on Wednesday, with the American ambassador,

275
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:15,619
on Thursday,
with the New Zealand High Commissioner.

276
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:18,428
- How many countries in the UN?
- 158.

277
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,025
That'll take up six months,
then we'll start round again.

278
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:26,865
You can't have lunch with ambassadors
every day. There will be other official lunches.

279
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,537
Even better. We'll fill up the odd gaps.

280
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:34,066
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
might have some views on that.

281
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,426
They say that one Prime Minister's lunch
with an ambassador

282
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,057
destroys two years of patient diplomacy.

283
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:43,107
I'm not quite sure how they'd react to 158.

284
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:48,021
- It's absurd that no one caters for us here.
- It's been like that for 250 years.

285
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:51,141
- That's the clinching argument?
- For 250 years, yes.

286
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:54,546
It can't have been the clinching argument
for 250 years.

287
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,907
50 years ago, it had only been
the clinching argument for 200 years

288
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,339
and 100 years ago...

289
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,587
Sorry.

290
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,226
Humphrey, I want a cook/housekeeper
and I want you to see that she's paid for.

291
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,818
Well, let me put it like this.

292
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:15,380
Do you want the press to announce
that your first act as Prime Minister

293
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,178
was to give yourself
a salary increase of ?,000 to ?0,000?

294
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,465
We wouldn't tell them.

295
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:25,622
We have no alternative.
Prime Ministers' expenses must be published.

296
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:30,664
- There's no way that we can't not tell them?
- Open government. Freedom of information.

297
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,657
We should always tell the press
freely and frankly anything

298
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:38,185
that they could easily find out some other way.

299
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,821
- There must be some solution.
- There hasn't been for 250 years.

300
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,858
Now may we discuss government business?
You were saying that you'd been thinking.

301
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:53,260
Ah, yes. We're agreed that so far
my premiership has been a great success.

302
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,187
Oh, indeed.

303
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:59,661
I've been asking myself what can I do
to continue this run of success.

304
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:03,305
Have you considered masterly inactivity?

305
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,262
No, Humphrey, a Prime Minister must be firm.

306
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:10,737
Indeed. How about firm masterly inactivity?

307
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,940
No, I shall be firm.

308
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:18,103
I've decided to cancel Trident,
channel ?5 billion into conventional forces

309
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,908
and reintroduce conscription.

310
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:25,665
At one stroke, we shall solve
our defence, balance of payments,

311
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,344
unemployment and educational problems
all at once.

312
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,828
What do you say, Humphrey?

313
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,867
You can't reorganise the entire defence
of the realm just like that.

314
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,902
I'm the Prime Minister. I have the power.

315
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:47,063
Yes, within the law and the constitution
and the constraints of administrative precedent,

316
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,027
budgetary feasibility and cabinet government.

317
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:53,704
- You'll buy Cruise instead?
- No, no more nuclear weapons.

318
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,140
But, Prime Minister...
You're not a secret unilateralist?

319
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:01,342
- No, we still have Polaris.
- Polaris is a ramshackle old system.

320
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:07,618
The Soviets might develop a ballistic missile
defence system which could intercept Polaris.

321
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:11,617
- By when?
- In strategic terms, any day now.

322
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:13,939
By what year precisely?

323
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:17,181
2020? But that's sooner than you think!

324
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:22,383
Are you saying that this nuclear defence system
would stop all 192 Polaris missiles?

325
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,904
Not all, virtually all - 97%.

326
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,061
That would leave five bombs
that would get through?

327
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,978
- A mere five!
- Obliterating Moscow, Leningrad and Minsk.

328
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,862
Yes, but that's about all.

329
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,589
Enough to make the Russians stop and think.

330
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,385
But it's not fair. With Trident we could
obliterate the whole of eastern Europe!

331
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,540
- I don't want to!
- It's a deterrent.

332
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:48,497
- It's a bluff. I probably wouldn't use it.
- They don't know you probably wouldn't.

333
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,139
- They probably do.
- Yes, probably, but they can't certainly know.

334
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,987
They probably certainly know.

335
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,704
Yes, but though they probably certainly know
that you probably wouldn't,

336
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:00,383
they don't certainly know
that although you probably wouldn't,

337
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,063
there's no probability that you certainly would!

338
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,628
What?

339
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,949
It all boils down to one simple issue.

340
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:17,103
You are the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
Shouldn't Great Britain have the best?

341
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,186
Yes, of course.

342
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:23,740
If you walked into a nuclear missile showroom,
you would buy Trident!

343
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,628
It's lovely, it's elegant, it's beautiful.

344
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,782
It is quite simply the best,
and Britain should have the best.

345
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,703
In the world of the nuclear missile,
it is the Savile Row suit,

346
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:37,144
the Rolls-Royce Corniche,

347
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:39,823
the Ch鈚eau Lafite 1945.

348
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:43,902
It is the nuclear missile Harrods would sell you.

349
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:49,183
What more can I say?

350
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:51,909
That it costs ?5 billion and we don't need it.

351
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:54,583
You can say that about anything at Harrods.

352
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,618
(MURMUR OF CONVERSATION)

353
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,461
Ah, General!
I was hoping to have a word with you.

354
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:13,304
I wanted to sound you out about something.
You'll not like it.

355
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:17,826
- Tell me the worst.
- It will be very unpopular with the services.

356
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:20,503
- I'm planning to cancel Trident.
- Good idea.

357
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,457
Now, hold on, don't jump in too quickly.
No good trying to argue...

358
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,617
- What did you say?
- It's a good idea.

359
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,021
- You're in favour? Why?
- We don't need it. Complete waste of money.

360
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:34,618
- That's what I said.
- You're right.

361
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,577
- The whole defence staff agree?
- The navy want to keep it.

362
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:42,537
Take away Trident
and they'd hardly have a role left.

363
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:45,263
- And the RAF?
- You could ask them.

364
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,900
If you're interested in the opinion
of garage mechanics. They'd want to keep it.

365
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,583
They want to drop the bomb from an aeroplane.

366
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:56,537
They just like dropping things on people,
but they're no good at it.

367
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:59,263
Couldn't even close the runway at Port Stanley.

368
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,705
Probably never find Moscow,
and if they did they'd miss it.

369
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,902
How do we get the policy through
if only the army is in favour?

370
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:10,744
As you know, the Chief of Defence Staff job
is becoming vacant.

371
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,026
Technically, it's the navy's turn,
but it's your decision.

372
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,657
If you appoint a soldier, it's up to you.

373
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,020
General, aren't you the most senior soldier?

374
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,618
As it happens, I believe I am.

375
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,379
Thank you. Good advice.

376
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,665
Prime Minister, this is Mrs Glossop.

377
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:30,665
- Extraordinary thing!
- What?

378
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,821
I've come across a Prime Minister
with a bit of sense.

379
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,457
Really? Where? Which is the lucky country?

380
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:41,304
Ours. He's cancelling Trident.
I could hardly believe my ears.

381
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:44,984
I'm surprised you're happy
about reintroducing conscription.

382
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:49,819
- He didn't say anything about conscription.
- Slashes unemployment, wins votes.

383
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:54,341
We're an elite army, best in the world.
Professional, tough, disciplined.

384
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,900
We can't bring in a mob of punks
and freaks and junkies and riff-raff.

385
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,183
A quarter of a million football hooligans?

386
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:06,464
- Peeling potatoes in Aldershot?
- I thought you'd say that.

387
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:10,542
- It'll be just an ordinary army.
- Like the one that won the last war?

388
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,701
All this equal opportunity nonsense, like America!

389
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,784
They don't know if the troops posted to them
are men or women, not until they arrive.

390
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,383
- Sometimes not even then.
- Quite!

391
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:25,059
- Much better to keep Trident.
- I thought you'd say that.

392
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:29,017
- You must stop him.
- One can't just stop the Prime Minister.

393
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,657
- What do we do?
- We must slow him down.

394
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:36,823
After a few months, most new Prime Ministers
have more or less ground to a halt anyway.

395
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:40,982
I'll have a word with the American ambassador
tomorrow morning.

396
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,617
- Good idea.
- I thought you'd say that.

397
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,302
Oh, hello!

398
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:50,463
I want to make sure that the BBC and ITN get
good coverage on the White House lawn.

399
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:56,147
Shot of me and the President. Then there'll be
more photo coverage inside the White House.

400
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,862
Splendid.

401
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:02,819
Then there'll be coverage of me and the President
at the start of talks the next day.

402
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:05,503
Then the President will say goodbye to me.

403
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,459
I hope he takes my elbow with his left hand.
He did that with the West German Chancellor.

404
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,826
Any chance of ensuring that beforehand
with the embassy?

405
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:17,863
That could be difficult.
Could you look at the Cabinet agenda?

406
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,537
I don't know what we have embassies for.

407
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:25,225
Any time you ask them to do something
really important, important for Britain...

408
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,860
- Weren't we to discuss scrapping Trident?
- Indeed we were, Prime Minister.

409
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,659
But I thought in the first instance you might
think it wiser to go into it thoroughly,

410
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:39,425
review all the implications,
as we are discussing the defence of the realm.

411
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:44,419
- You're trying to stop me, Humphrey.
- No, but the Cabinet must have all the facts.

412
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:46,620
That's a novel idea.

413
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:52,019
There is a special reason why I thought
you might want to leave it for a while.

414
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:56,979
I've learned from the American ambassador
informally that they would be very upset

415
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,381
if we were to cancel Trident
and not order another of their missiles instead.

416
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:04,308
I might as well have it out with the President.

417
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:09,981
That's the point. The agenda of your meeting
with the President must be agreed in advance.

418
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:12,743
You can't just go over there for a chat.

419
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:15,144
- Why not?
- Well, you...

420
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,217
You might not think of anything to say.

421
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:24,587
If this proposal of yours were to be put to
the Americans, there would be a change of plan.

422
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:28,782
- What change of plan?
- Your meeting would not be with the President.

423
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:32,737
- You'd be entertained by the Vice-President.
- The Vice-President?!

424
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,584
- You can't be serious!
- I'm afraid so, Prime Minister.

425
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,748
Even Botswana was met by the President.
I saw it on the news.

426
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,140
Botswana hadn't just cancelled an order for Trident.

427
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:49,383
I'm sure they'll explain that the President
had catarrh or bruised his thumb or something.

428
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:52,579
Fallen asleep perhaps.

429
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,703
This meeting with the President is vital for PR.

430
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,060
Then you should postpone the Trident discussion.

431
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:05,423
A Prime Minister must show that there is
a new mind and a firm hand at Number 10.

432
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:08,057
He must be seen to have made his mark.

433
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,743
- But you have, Prime Minister.
- How?

434
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:18,025
A cook...
seconded from the Cabinet Office canteen?

435
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,547
To cook lunch for me here at the flat?

436
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:27,622
Something that none of your predecessors
ever accomplished.

437
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,142
A place in the history books.

438
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:37,824
I say! We've shown them who's in charge,
haven't we?

439
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,497
Indeed we have, Prime Minister.

440
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,547
A new mind and a firm hand and Trident.

441
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,217
A place in the history books, you say.

442
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:51,179
Oh, leave Trident off the Cabinet agenda
for the time being. That is my firm decision.

443
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:54,028
- All right?
- Yes, Prime Minister.
