00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:53,397
Sir Humphrey is waiting to see you,
Prime Minister.

2
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,920
Thank you, Bernard. Show him in.

3
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,195
Yes, Prime Minister.

4
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:05,883
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Ah, Humphrey, good morning.

5
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,076
How's the jet lag?

6
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:14,157
I'm not jet-lagged. No, I find that jet lag
affects me more going the other way.

7
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:19,833
I felt frightfully tired at the White House.
I can scarcely remember a thing he said.

8
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:24,163
He didn't really say much, Prime Minister.
He was frightfully tired too.

9
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:29,197
Bit worrying, isn't it? Statesmen such as myself
jetting all over the world,

10
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:34,041
attending major conferences on the future
of mankind and we're zonked?

11
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,634
It would be, Prime Minister.

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,799
Perhaps that's why negotiations are done
in advance by humble servants such as I.

13
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:45,397
They can hardly be left
in the hands of the zonked.

14
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,599
Now, what did you want to see me about?

15
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:52,759
Prime Minister? Prime Minister!

16
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:56,241
Ah, yes, Bernard. Ah, Humphrey, good morning!

17
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,561
- You wanted to see me.
- Oh. Did I?

18
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:06,602
- Don't you know what it was about?
- He fell asleep before he told me.

19
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:11,043
I'll be back if I'm needed.
Bernard, I'd like a word when you're free.

20
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,480
(DOOR CLOSES)

21
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,636
Ah, Bernard.

22
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,200
Remind me to see Humphrey...

23
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,160
..about something.

24
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:29,114
I suppose now I'm back,
I've got a huge backlog of work?

25
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,680
- Not really.
- No backlog?

26
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:37,357
Nothing at all. You have much less to do
as Prime Minister. You don't have a department.

27
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,954
Bernard, you can't be serious.

28
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:45,119
Everything you've read about how hard a Prime
Minister has to work is a bit of a myth really.

29
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:48,402
It's put out by the Press Office
as a matter of course.

30
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:51,363
If you think about it, what do you have to do?

31
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:54,557
- Chair the Cabinet.
- Two and a half hours a week.

32
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:57,842
- Chair a couple of Cabinet committees.
- Four hours.

33
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:01,998
- Answer questions in the House twice a week.
- Another half an hour.

34
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,725
- Er...
- Audience with the Queen on Tuesdays.

35
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,917
- Another hour.
- Seven and a half hours a week so far.

36
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,803
Bernard, there must be more to it than that.

37
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:16,959
You have to read all the briefs and we rush you
from place to place shaking hands with people.

38
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,596
There's lots of things people want you to do
and lots of things you should do

39
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:26,156
and any number of things you CAN do,
but very few things you HAVE to do.

40
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,714
It's up to you. You're the boss.

41
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,399
Thank you, Bernard. I'll bear that in mind.

42
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:36,719
Let's have the Press Secretary in to discuss
my first TV broadcast as Prime Minister.

43
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:40,602
Send Malcolm Warren up here
straight away, please.

44
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,484
I was busy in America. It was a great success.

45
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,673
- Was it?
- Of course it was, Bernard.

46
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:51,839
Haven't you read Malcolm's report? I was
on all the news bulletins three nights running.

47
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:56,954
Special feature on ''Panorama'',
1,269 column inches in the nationals.

48
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,719
31 photos, 16 radio reports.

49
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,917
No, was it a success in terms of what it achieved?

50
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,076
I just told you.

51
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,237
No, what about agreements with the Americans?

52
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:12,876
Your private conversation with the President?
You didn't tell me the result.

53
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:17,561
Oh, that. To begin with, I read him my brief
and he read me his brief.

54
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,719
Then we decided it would be quicker if we just
swapped briefs and read them to ourselves.

55
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,877
We spent most of the time rubbishing the French.

56
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:27,924
Terrific.

57
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,275
- Good.
- (PHONE RINGS)

58
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:32,436
Yes...? Oh, thanks.

59
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,995
Malcolm Warren is on his way up, Prime Minister.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

62
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:52,796
Ah, Bernard. How's the Prime Minister
and First Lord of the Treasury?

63
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:56,844
- Sleeping peacefully, Sir Humphrey.
- Bernard, we have a problem.

64
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,202
- Who has?
- You and I and the whole of Whitehall.

65
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:04,358
The problem is the Prime Minister's
disastrous new defence ideas -

66
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:08,518
cancelling Trident,
reintroducing conscription and all that rubbish.

67
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,963
- The Grand Design?
- That's what he calls it.

68
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,118
- If it reduces unemployment...
- What is the purpose of our defence policy?

69
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,753
- To defend Britain.
- No, Bernard.

70
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,917
It is to make people BELIEVE Britain is defended.

71
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:26,759
- The Russians?
- Not the Russians, the British!

72
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,920
The Russians know it's not.

73
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:35,675
It's for all our simple, ignorant people
shuffling in and out of houses, buses, factories

74
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,836
and the Cabinet room.

75
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,360
We want to make them feel secure.

76
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:45,559
- But if there's a better way...
- Bernard, we have a magic wand - Trident.

77
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:50,845
Nobody understands anything about it,
except that it will cost ?5 billion,

78
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,519
which means it must be wonderful, magical.

79
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,564
All we have to do is write a cheque
and then we can all relax,

80
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,797
but if people in government start talking about it,

81
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,479
in the end, they'll start THINKING about it.

82
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:09,078
They will come to realise the problems,
the flaws in the reasoning.

83
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:14,080
The nation will get worried -
agitation, questions, criticism...change.

84
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:17,197
- Change?
- Change.

85
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:23,082
There is one thing, though - this TV broadcast.
Suppose he uses it to announce his new policy?

86
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:28,040
- It has to go through Cabinet and the House.
- He can open the national debate.

87
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:31,920
You do not do that
until the government has made up its mind.

88
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,640
- If the Prime Minister has made up his mind...
- He must unmake it.

89
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,633
- But he's the Prime Minister.
- Yes, indeed he is, Bernard.

90
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:46,403
He has his own car, a nice house in London,
endless publicity and a pension for life.

91
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,760
What more does he want?

92
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,359
I think he wants to govern Britain.

93
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,755
Well, stop him, Bernard.

94
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,514
Should it be an interview or to camera?

95
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:59,917
Yes.

96
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,316
No, Prime Minister, it has to be one or the other.

97
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:07,273
What about an interview?
Bernard, we're discussing a TV interview.

98
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:11,358
Robin Day, Brian Walden,
Terry Wogan, Jimmy Young?

99
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:15,520
- Which do you think?
- It depends how you want to appear.

100
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,324
The thinker, man of power, people's friend?

101
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:23,240
- All of them really.
- They won't all interview you at the same time.

102
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:26,835
No, I want to be seen to have all those qualities.

103
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,878
Well, I think you should do it to camera.

104
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:35,039
Yes. At least it'll be me in charge and not
all those failed MPs and jumped-up DJs.

105
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:39,793
- Fine. A party political?
- No, a party political spells instant boredom.

106
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:45,358
I think it should be a ministerial broadcast,
the Prime Minister addressing his people,

107
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,517
but I'll do it into the camera like a party political.

108
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:53,196
- I thought you said they were boring.
- I didn't say I'D be boring, Bernard.

109
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,160
Do you think I'd be boring?

110
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,836
Boring? You?

111
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,754
- Have you done much talking to camera?
- No, mostly interviews.

112
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:09,601
Then I'd better set up a practice session.
What is the broadcast to be about?

113
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:13,915
- About?
- Yes, about. What will it be about?

114
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,960
About me.

115
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,520
Yes, but what are you gonna say?

116
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:21,277
Say?

117
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,476
About policies.

118
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:28,639
Policies, yes. I thought it'd be the usual thing -
go forward together, better tomorrow,

119
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:32,434
tighten your belt, all pull together,
heal the wounds.

120
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:36,118
Yes, but what will you be saying specifically?

121
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,474
Oh, specifically.

122
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:44,161
Well, I thought I'd suggest
that we all specifically tighten our belts.

123
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:49,681
And specifically heal the specific wounds
in society. See what I mean?

124
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:55,243
It's entirely up to you, Prime Minister. I just
thought if you had anything new to say...?

125
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:56,997
New?

126
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:01,443
Oh, new! Yes, of course!
Get Humphrey back here, will you?

127
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:05,314
My Grand Design. That's what I wanted
to talk to Humphrey about.

128
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:10,278
Sir Humphrey, the Prime Minister
is making arrangements for his TV broadcast.

129
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:13,960
He wants to talk about his Grand Design
and wonders if you...

130
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,444
Hello?

131
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,994
I think he's on his way.

132
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:24,118
- Grand Design?
- I can't tell you now, but it's a big story.

133
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:28,841
I'll find a producer and set up
a practice session in the meantime.

134
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,602
- That was quick.
- You want to discuss a TV appearance?

135
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,199
Yes. It's not so desperately urgent.

136
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,515
Not remotely important.

137
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:44,876
My first television broadcast as Prime Minister?

138
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,363
Terribly important, of course,
but not a crisis, not a panic.

139
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,875
I want to announce my new defence policy.
What do you think?

140
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:55,036
- No!
- Pardon?

141
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,315
- It's a mistake.
- The policy?

142
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:02,315
Well, of course, it's tremendously refreshing
to have a new mind on the problem.

143
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:07,479
Challenging the old ideas, questioning the whole
basis of government thinking for 30 years.

144
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:10,677
- You don't approve of the policy?
- It's not that.

145
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:13,837
There'll be implications,
reverberations, repercussions.

146
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,599
We have to weigh the evidence, review, consult.

147
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:20,002
You get on with that
and I'll announce it in the broadcast.

148
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:22,765
You can't. Not yet.

149
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:27,123
Well, we have to tell the Americans.
They will have grave objections.

150
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:32,359
It will take many months of patient diplomacy.
Delicate issues need sensitive handling.

151
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,558
Who is it who has the last word
about the government of Britain?

152
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,637
The British Cabinet or the American President?

153
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,399
Do you know, that's a fascinating question!

154
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:47,113
- We often discuss it.
- What conclusion have you arrived at?

155
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:52,115
Well, I must admit to being a bit of a heretic.
I think it's the British Cabinet, but...

156
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,674
I know I'm in the minority.

157
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,274
From now on, you're in the majority.

158
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:01,233
I shall raise my Grand Design
with the Overseas Defence Committee,

159
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,714
then I shall put it to Cabinet.

160
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,353
I've sounded most of them out privately.

161
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:10,518
They think it's a vote-winner...
a major contribution to our defence.

162
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:14,075
I'll put it to the House,
then announce it in my broadcast.

163
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:18,278
- Sorry, you can't announce it yet.
- Well, if I can't, who can?

164
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:24,077
So let us be abundantly clear about this.

165
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,961
We cannot go on paying ourselves
more than we earn.

166
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,159
The rest of the world does not owe us a living.

167
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:36,441
We must be prepared to make sacrifices and...
Who wrote this rubbish?

168
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:42,755
You did, Prime Minister.
It's one of your old speeches.

169
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:46,395
- What about a draft of the broadcast?
- It's still only a draft.

170
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:48,999
- This is only a practice.
- It's confidential.

171
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:52,356
- Everyone's been cleared. Go on.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

172
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:56,558
- How was that, Godfrey?
- Excellent, Prime Minister. Just one thing.

173
00:11:57,325 --> 00:12:00,795
- Will you be wearing those glasses?
- What do you think?

174
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:05,356
It's up to you. With them on,
you look authoritative and commanding.

175
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:08,319
With them off, you look honest and open.

176
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,039
I want to look authoritative AND honest.

177
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,713
It's one or the other really.

178
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:17,759
I could start with them off
and put them on when I talk?

179
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,877
- That just looks indecisive.
- Oh, I see.

180
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,280
What about a monocle?

181
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:31,720
Let's just leave them off for the moment,
shall we? Can we go again?

182
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,600
- Have you got that new script, Bernard?
- Yes, Prime Minister.

183
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:39,075
The Trident programme is too expensive.

184
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,082
By cancelling it, we shall release billions of pounds

185
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:47,204
to fund an imaginative and radical attack
on the nation's problems.

186
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,956
- What this country needs...
- Can we hold it?

187
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,117
- What was wrong?
- No, it was very good.

188
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,958
- Prime Minister...
- Just a minute. Yes?

189
00:12:57,165 --> 00:13:02,159
Do you mind not leaning forward? It makes
you look as though you're selling insurance.

190
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:06,477
And also it makes you look up at the lens
like a sort of suppliant.

191
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,318
You should be looking down from on high.

192
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:14,361
What this country needs...
What this country needs...

193
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,515
What this country needs...

194
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:22,560
Prime Minister, Malcolm and I have drafted
a slightly different version to this speech.

195
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:27,555
''We shall review a wide range of options
over the whole field of government expenditure.''

196
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,717
- This doesn't say anything.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

197
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,353
- Completely lacking impact.
- You're too kind.

198
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:37,438
- No, I don't like it.
- You could say ''urgently review''.

199
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:41,075
- No.
- I do think it should be toned down a bit.

200
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,435
Any thoughts, Malcolm?

201
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,996
What about ''the Trident programme
is a heavy burden on your tax bill.

202
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:52,477
''We should look at it carefully
to see if it merits the ?5 billion it costs.''

203
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,560
All right. It's OK to mention figures?

204
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:00,716
Yes. Practically no one takes them in
and those who do don't believe them,

205
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:04,878
but it makes people think
you've got the facts at your fingertips.

206
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,037
People don't know
you're reading them off the teleprompter.

207
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,197
- Otherwise, it was fine?
- You were going a bit slowly.

208
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,965
The teleprompter was going a bit slowly.

209
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:18,761
No, no. It follows your speed.
Try going slow and then fast.

210
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,280
- Oh, I see.
- And cue.

211
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:25,199
The...Trident...programme...is...a...heavy...

212
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,358
(VERY QUICKLY) ..burden on your tax bill.
?5 billion is a lot of money.

213
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,800
I see what you mean, yes.

214
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,998
Would you mind not saying ''YOUR tax bill''?

215
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,843
Why not?

216
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:43,362
It makes you sound like the ruler
talking to the ruled, them and us.

217
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:47,717
- What should I say?
- ''OUR tax bill''? You pay taxes, too.

218
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,440
- Yes. Change that, Bernard.
- It's still very direct.

219
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:56,156
- Good. Thank you, Bernard.
- No, lots of people's jobs depend on Trident.

220
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:59,476
- Until there's been a consultation...
- Yes. Malcolm?

221
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:04,679
We could say, ''Defence expenditure is one
of those areas which we will look at closely

222
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:08,281
''to see if we can meet our defence needs
at a lower cost.''

223
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,118
- Can you make it two sentences?
- Why?

224
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:16,035
Prime Minister, we find
that if a sentence goes on over three lines,

225
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:21,438
then by the time it gets to the end,
most people will have forgotten how it began.

226
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:23,875
Two sentences, Malcolm.

227
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,798
And you are leaning forward again a bit.

228
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,443
That's what I do when I want to look sincere.

229
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:34,433
It makes you look like someone
who wants to look sincere.

230
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:38,277
If you lean back, you look relaxed and in control.

231
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,998
That's it.

232
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:46,595
Don't lean back quite as far as that.
It looks as though you've had a liquid lunch.

233
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,876
You can always underline bits of the script
where you want to look sincere,

234
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:56,117
then you just frown
and say them a bit more slowly.

235
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,395
Anything else?

236
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,954
Well, your face is a bit wooden.

237
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:02,964
Wooden?

238
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,593
Yeah, only when you're speaking.

239
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:10,555
In normal speech, you move your head
and eyebrows and cheek muscles and so on.

240
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:14,513
Don't let the teleprompter
turn you into a zombie. OK? And cue!

241
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:18,041
Defence expenditure is one of the areas...

242
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,956
which this government will be examining closely.

243
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,836
It may be that we can achieve the same...

244
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:29,998
Prime Minister, that's just a little bit too much.

245
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,798
You'll have heard a lot of nonsense
from the opposition.

246
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,115
They say we waste money.

247
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,118
They say we're selling out to the United States.

248
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:44,482
I say look at the mess they made
when they were in power,

249
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:47,364
look at the damage they did to the economy...

250
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:52,559
Could we hold it there? Prime Minister,
if I might suggest, don't attack the opposition.

251
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:55,518
Oh. Those are the bits the party likes.

252
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,153
Now, the party will vote for you anyway.

253
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:02,876
You'll make the floating voter see you
as an angry and divisive figure.

254
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:07,038
- I see. What should I say about them?
- Don't mention them at all.

255
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:10,993
Everything you say
has to make you sound warm and friendly.

256
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,963
Authoritative, of course, but affectionate.

257
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,355
The father of the nation.

258
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:20,279
Could we just run forward to that, um,
that new bit?

259
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:25,034
Try lowering the pitch of your voice. All right?

260
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,074
(HIGH VOICE) We want...

261
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:34,033
(DEEP VOICE) We want to build
a bright future for our children.

262
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:37,720
We want to build
a peaceful and prosperous Britain,

263
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:41,673
a Britain that can hold her head high
in the fellowship of nations.

264
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:44,359
This is rather good. Who wrote this?

265
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:49,195
Actually, it's from the last party political
by the leader of the opposition.

266
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:54,038
As for your appearance, what will you wear?

267
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:58,443
- What do you suggest?
- A dark suit represents traditional values.

268
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:01,802
- Fine, dark suit.
- But a light suit looks business-like.

269
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:05,202
What about a lightish jacket
with a darkish waistcoat?

270
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,673
I think that would look
as though you've got an identity problem.

271
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:14,441
Excuse me, Prime Minister.
Godfrey, could we have a word about make-up?

272
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,800
- Shall we darken the grey hair?
- No, it's fine.

273
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,082
- And the receding hairline?
- Receding what?

274
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,675
High forehead.

275
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:32,879
And can you try to do something about the eyes,
make them look less close-set?

276
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,524
Sure.

277
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,673
Lighten the bags underneath.

278
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,678
- The nose is still a problem.
- Problem?

279
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:46,720
No, just a lighting problem, Prime Minister.
A very large, um, shadow.

280
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,154
The teeth, of course.

281
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,833
Could you smile, Prime Minister?

282
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,603
Yes...

283
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:08,880
Prime Minister, how would you feel
about a little dental work?

284
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,320
Can we get on with this?

285
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,635
OK, we're going again.

286
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,399
Super. And cue the Prime Minister.

287
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:22,396
We shall review a wide range of options over
the whole field of government expenditure...

288
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:27,355
- Bernard, this is what we started with.
- I do think it's the most appropriate.

289
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:31,313
- What do you think, Godfrey?
- It's up to you, Prime Minister.

290
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,477
All I can say is,
if that's what you're going to say,

291
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,284
I suggest a very modern suit, hi-tech furniture,

292
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,562
high-energy yellow wallpaper, abstract paintings.

293
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:44,877
In fact, everything to disguise
the absence of anything new in the speech.

294
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:48,873
I'll go back to my original dynamic speech
about the Grand Design.

295
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:53,835
Fine, then it's the reassuring traditional
background, dark suit, oak panelling,

296
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:56,473
leather volumes, 18th-century portraits.

297
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,034
One other thing - opening music.

298
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:03,437
Once again, Bach - new ideas;
Stravinsky - no change.

299
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:08,921
I think I ought to have a British composer,
something that would reflect my image.

300
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,883
- Elgar perhaps?
- Elgar, yes, yes.

301
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,434
Not ''Land of Hope and Glory''.

302
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,273
What about the ''Enigma Variations''?

303
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,557
He's going to say something new and radical.

304
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:27,520
That silly Grand Design? Bernard,
that was precisely what you had to avoid!

305
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,438
I shall need a very good explanation!

306
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:34,115
- He's very keen on it.
- What's that got to do with it?

307
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:38,483
Things don't happen just because
Prime Ministers are keen on them.

308
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,159
Neville Chamberlain was very keen on peace!

309
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,523
He thinks it's a vote-winner.

310
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:49,837
Ah. That's more serious. Sit down.
What makes him think that?

311
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:54,436
The party did an opinion poll and all
the voters were in favour of national service.

312
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:58,957
Have another opinion poll done
showing they're AGAINST national service.

313
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:02,441
- They can't be for AND against it.
- Ever been surveyed?

314
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:06,154
Yes. Well, not me, my house.
Oh, I see what you mean.

315
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:09,123
Bernard, a nice young lady comes up to you.

316
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:13,756
You want to create a good impression,
you don't want to look a fool, do you?

317
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:16,917
- No.
- So she starts asking you some questions.

318
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:21,681
Mr Woolley, are you worried about the number
of young people without jobs?

319
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:23,604
Yes.

320
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,757
Are you worried about rising crime
among teenagers?

321
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,957
- Yes.
- Do you think our schools lack discipline?

322
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,604
Yes.

323
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:35,235
Do you think young people welcome
authority and leadership?

324
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,595
- Yes.
- They like a challenge?

325
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,763
- Yes.
- Would you be in favour of national service?

326
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:46,673
- I suppose I might be.
- Yes or no?

327
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:50,798
- Yes.
- After all you've told me, you can't say no.

328
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:55,154
They don't mention the first five questions
and publish the last one.

329
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:57,674
Is that really what they do?

330
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:01,155
Not the reputable ones,
but there aren't many of those.

331
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:04,635
Alternatively,
the young lady can get the opposite result.

332
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:08,076
- How?
- Mr Woolley, are you worried about war?

333
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,799
- Yes.
- Are you worried about the arms race?

334
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:14,878
- Yes.
- Is it dangerous giving young people guns?

335
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:18,680
- Yes.
- Is it wrong to force people to take up arms?

336
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:22,878
- Yes.
- Would you oppose national service?

337
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,564
Yes.

338
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:30,203
There you are, you see, Bernard.
The perfect balanced sample.

339
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,996
So we just commission our own survey
for the Ministry of Defence. See to it.

340
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,157
- What about the broadcast?
- When will he do it?

341
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,441
Some time next month.

342
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:43,994
Tell him it'll be in 11 days' time.

343
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:47,043
That's a bit soon. Suppose he refuses?

344
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:50,993
Tell him that we've learnt
from the Joint Broadcasting Committee

345
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:54,601
that the opposition will hold
a party political in 18 days' time

346
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,154
and he can get his ministerial in first.

347
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:02,353
If he wants the first political broadcast of his
premiership to be given by the opposition, fine.

348
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:05,675
Erm, is that true?

349
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,878
It will be...
if you don't mention it till tomorrow.

350
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,555
- He could still announce his new policy.
- I don't think so.

351
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,842
He'll have only one meeting
with his Cabinet colleagues.

352
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,240
They're all in favour of it.

353
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:25,042
Only personally and politically, but are they
in favour as responsible departmental ministers?

354
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:28,282
I see. That will depend on the advice they get.

355
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:38,720
I understand, of course, there's no question
of our opposing this scheme to cancel Trident.

356
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:43,919
It's a question of holding back a little until
we've thought through all the implications.

357
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:47,964
So what are you going to brief your man
at Employment to say?

358
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,520
What are the others saying?

359
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:54,678
Will Dick brief the Foreign Secretary
to say the Americans will hit the roof?

360
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,643
No, he thinks it might be more persuasive

361
00:23:57,805 --> 00:24:02,959
to argue that cancelling Trident
will look like weakness, appeasing the Soviets.

362
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,636
Good thinking.

363
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,273
Just as Norman won't tell his man at Defence

364
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:13,155
to say that the service chiefs won't have
their elite forces diluted with riff-raff.

365
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:17,284
- But they won't?
- He felt they needed another argument.

366
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:23,674
Two? Two arguments? Isn't that putting rather
a strain on the Defence Secretary's somewhat...

367
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:27,161
Obsolete intellectual equipment? Yes.

368
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:33,276
He's just going to brief him that Trident
is best and Britain must have the best.

369
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:37,956
Oh, good. Even the Defence Secretary
should be able to handle that.

370
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,554
With a bit of coaching, yes.

371
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,716
And Giles? I know!

372
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:47,675
The National Union of Teachers are scared stiff
that conscription will expose the fact

373
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:52,919
that school leavers, while tremendously
integrated socially and creatively aware...

374
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,117
Can't actually read, write or do sums, yes.

375
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:59,873
Giles has got the Education Secretary worried

376
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:04,516
that the colleges prefer their education
to be taken over by the services

377
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:07,153
and actually used for teaching people.

378
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:12,602
- We can't have that.
- No. So what about your man at Employment?

379
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:14,835
It's the same problem.

380
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:19,283
The truth is the unions don't want
kids undercutting them on community work.

381
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:20,804
Yes.

382
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:24,355
I don't think we need
to bring the truth in at this stage.

383
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:27,842
Hold on.

384
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,675
Now, suppose he argues

385
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:33,917
that unemployed young people are, at the moment,

386
00:25:34,085 --> 00:25:37,236
unfit, unorganised, undisciplined and untrained,

387
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:42,160
but that conscription
will eventually release on to the streets

388
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:46,079
an army of fit young people, all trained to kill.

389
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:48,716
Good man!

390
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,874
Does he actually believe that?

391
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,434
He will by tomorrow morning.

392
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:58,916
Ah, Humphrey.

393
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,076
Gentlemen. Sorry.

394
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,556
Good committee, Prime Minister?

395
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:07,637
- Extraordinary. Extraordinary.
- How extraordinary?

396
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:11,315
Last week, all my colleagues
were all for my Grand Design.

397
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,157
And now?

398
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:16,317
The Foreign Secretary says
it would appease the Soviets.

399
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,874
I hadn't thought of that.

400
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:23,124
The Defence Secretary says Trident is best
and Britain must have the best.

401
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:25,964
Does he really? How fascinating!

402
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:31,475
The Education Secretary says conscription
would undermine the educational system.

403
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:34,398
It is a worry. And the Employment Secretary?

404
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:41,044
Well, he goes on about a million unemployed
trained fighters being let loose on the streets.

405
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:44,635
- Well, he has a point there.
- I don't understand it.

406
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:50,198
Last week, they all thought my new defence
policy was a winner. Can you explain it?

407
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,873
It's beyond me, Prime Minister. Yes, Bernard?

408
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,674
Sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister.
The MoD said it was urgent.

409
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,878
What?

410
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,873
It seems that 74%
of the population are against conscription.

411
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,119
74...? Good Lord!

412
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:13,641
The party poll said
that 63% of the population was for it.

413
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:18,714
You see, party figures can be very unreliable,
Prime Minister.

414
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:21,638
- Evidently.
- May I suggest a compromise?

415
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:27,559
Well, it's clear that the committee's agreed
that your new policy is an excellent plan,

416
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,193
but in view of some of the doubts expressed,

417
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:35,359
may I propose that after careful consideration,
the considered view of the committee was

418
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:38,915
that while the proposal met
with broad approval in principle,

419
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:42,873
some of the principles
were sufficiently fundamental in principle

420
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:47,243
and some of the considerations
so complex and finely balanced in practice

421
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:51,523
that in principle it was proposed
that the sensible and prudent practice

422
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:55,473
would be to submit the proposal
for more detailed consideration,

423
00:27:55,645 --> 00:28:00,036
stressing the essential continuity
of the new proposal with existing principles

424
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:02,673
and the principle of the principal arguments

425
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:07,316
which the proposer proposes and propounds
for their approval...in principle.

426
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:10,283
What?

427
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:14,524
Don't refer to your Grand Design
in your television broadcast on Friday.

428
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:18,800
- You're not suggesting I should abandon it?
- Good heavens, no!

429
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,433
Heaven forbid! It is a most excellent policy!

430
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:25,873
All right. We'll look into it further
before I say anything about it.

431
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:30,954
The TV people want a decision about
the background scenery for the broadcast.

432
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:36,995
I suppose it had better be the modern suit with
the hi-tech furniture and the yellow wallpaper.

433
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:39,315
And abstract paintings?

434
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:42,119
I suppose so. And Stravinsky?

435
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,793
(BOTH) Yes, Prime Minister.
