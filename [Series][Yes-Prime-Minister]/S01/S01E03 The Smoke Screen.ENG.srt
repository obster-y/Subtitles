1
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,327
Frank, the problem is all new Prime Ministers
want to cut either taxes or public expenditure.

2
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,961
Thank you. That's what Hacker wants, too.

3
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,203
Politicians are like children.

4
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:54,082
You can't just give them what they want.
It only encourages them!

5
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:57,006
But let's be clear about this, Humphrey.

6
00:00:57,613 --> 00:01:02,004
The entire system hinges on you
as Cabinet Secretary controlling the PM

7
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:06,405
and on me as Permanent Secretary
at the Treasury controlling the Chancellor.

8
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,131
- Right?
- Right.

9
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:13,003
And on both of us keeping an agreeable tension
between them, mistrust, hostility.

10
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:17,001
Mind you, I think they'd manage that all right
even without us.

11
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:22,167
The Chancellor will never forgive the Prime
Minister for beating him to Number 10

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,484
and the Prime Minister
will never trust the Chancellor.

13
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:29,282
- One never trusts anyone one has deceived.
- Perhaps not.

14
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:32,525
But tax cuts unite them. They get them both votes.

15
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:37,523
Yes, but surely this tax cut is contingent
upon the Prime Minister's fantasy

16
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:41,083
about cancelling Trident
and switching to conventional forces.

17
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:45,923
Nevertheless, he is giving away
?.5 billion of our money!

18
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:51,531
It's unthinkable, even if only proposals. I had
a real job getting the Chancellor to oppose it.

19
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,724
How did you do it?

20
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:58,523
I used the one about our needing the money
for hospitals, schools and old people.

21
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,685
- The kidney machine gambit.
- The caring Chancellor (!)

22
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,361
- Yes, that one.
- It usually works.

23
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:09,049
But would a tax cut matter all that much?
It's only ?.5 billion.

24
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:14,128
I agree, it's not much in itself. My worry
is about you letting it get through so soon.

25
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:18,207
If I were in your shoes at the Treasury,

26
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:23,128
I'd be much more worried about the state
of the economy, low productivity.

27
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,169
That's not our fault.

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,565
It's the British worker - fundamentally lazy,
wants something for nothing.

29
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,727
The figures for absenteeism are going up and up.
Nobody wants to do an honest day's work.

30
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:38,566
- Shocking! I must rush.
- Busy afternoon?

31
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:41,412
Yes, indeed. I gather England are 70 for 3.

32
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,483
(APPLAUSE)

33
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:52,282
Whoa, whoa! Easy does it, Gerald.

34
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:56,725
Plenty more where that came from.
Cheers. To the Civil Service!

35
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,252
To the British Tobacco Group and its chairman.

36
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,404
Thank you.

37
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:04,892
Ah!

38
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,567
I do love a good afternoon's cricket.

39
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:13,286
You know, you chaps at BTG
are national benefactors really.

40
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,444
We like to think so.

41
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:21,085
You know, Gerald, I've got a small favour
to ask on behalf of the Royal Opera House.

42
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:25,769
Now, as you know, Covent Garden
is more or less run from the Cabinet Office.

43
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:32,285
But I'm told that one or more productions
are threatened next year, lack of funds.

44
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:36,327
Well, I've got the Minister for Sport
coming along this afternoon.

45
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:41,487
I know he wants to twist my arm on behalf
of Wimbledon or Brands Hatch or something.

46
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,247
Covent Garden... We'll see what we can do.

47
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:47,405
Oh, I don't know where we'd all be without you.

48
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,527
Tell me, have you ever invited Peter Thorne?

49
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:53,890
- The Minister of Health?
- You always included them.

50
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:57,290
This one's been got at by the anti-smoking lobby.

51
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,563
Oh, silly man!

52
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,561
Very silly. He hasn't got
much clout in Whitehall, has he?

53
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,003
None at all. He's just a minister.

54
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,244
Good shot!

55
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,924
Was he out?

56
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:18,250
Humphrey, this paper says that
if we cancel Trident and bring in conscription,

57
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:21,723
we shall have ?.5 billion for tax cuts,
and what do I find?

58
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,926
- What do you find, Prime Minister?
- The Chancellor opposes me.

59
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:30,883
A great chance to be popular with the voters
and he says no. Doesn't that surprise you?

60
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,685
No.

61
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,323
Why doesn't it surprise you?

62
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:39,651
He's advised by the Treasury
and they don't believe in giving money back.

63
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,284
- It's not theirs. It's the taxpayers'.
- That's not the view the Treasury takes.

64
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,249
- Not once they've got it.
- But if they don't need it?

65
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,291
- Sorry?
- If they don't need it.

66
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:55,241
- Taxation isn't about what you need.
- What is it about?

67
00:04:55,413 --> 00:05:01,488
The Treasury doesn't work out what they need
to spend and then think how to raise the money.

68
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,684
What DOES it do?

69
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:08,847
They pitch for as much as they think they can
get away with, then think what to spend it on.

70
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:12,763
If you start giving money back
because you don't need it,

71
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,766
you're breaking with centuries of tradition.

72
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,926
- What would happen to the British Navy?
- We still need a navy.

73
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:25,127
We have four capital ships, so we need only
four admirals and one Admiral of the Fleet.

74
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,131
- How many Admirals have we got?
- 60.

75
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:33,001
The Treasury's the most powerful department
as it controls all the money.

76
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,927
If you take away its money,
you take away its power, so they resist.

77
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:41,331
- How will the Treasury agree to tax cuts?
- Get the Chancellor to agree.

78
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,605
- How will the Chancellor agree?
- Get the Treasury to agree.

79
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:48,442
- This is impossible.
- Yes, Prime Minister, it is impossible.

80
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:53,408
- We must be able to force the Treasury's hand.
- Yes, by forcing the Chancellor's hand.

81
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:57,447
- How do I force the Chancellor's hand?
- By forcing the Treasury's hand.

82
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:00,929
Can't YOU persuade the Chancellor?
He's your Cabinet colleague.

83
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,762
That's the point.
I need help from somebody who's on my side.

84
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:08,361
The Minister of State at the DHSS is here.

85
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:12,162
- Show him in. Thank you, Humphrey.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

86
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,325
- Dr Thorne, Prime Minister.
- Peter, come in.

87
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,364
Sit down.

88
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,445
Now, you wanted to talk to me about...?

89
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,967
- Cigarettes.
- Ah, yes.

90
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:28,091
- You read my paper?
- Yes, absolutely.

91
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,448
How did you react?

92
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:34,322
Well, I...wonder if you could summarise it
in your own words.

93
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,452
Those WERE my own words.

94
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,806
Yes, yes, exactly, of course.

95
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:48,565
But the Prime Minister often finds that a brief
summary focuses on the salient points.

96
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,122
Salient points, precisely.

97
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:57,167
Well, briefly, I'm proposing that the government
should take action to eliminate smoking,

98
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,087
a complete ban
on all cigarette sponsorship and advertising,

99
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:04,649
?0 million to be spent on anti-smoking publicity,

100
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:09,933
a ban on smoking in all public places and
progressive tax rises over the next five years

101
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,881
until a packet of 20 costs about the same
as a bottle of whisky.

102
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,208
Isn't that rather drastic?

103
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:23,328
Absolutely. It should reduce smoking
by at least 80%, 90% if we're lucky

104
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,053
and drive tobacco companies out of business.

105
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:31,330
Yes. Well, Peter, of course,
you know I agree with you basically.

106
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,848
Smoking should be stopped.

107
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:37,085
No question. And we will stop it in due course.

108
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:41,443
At the appropriate juncture,
in the fullness of time.

109
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,525
- You mean forget it?
- No, absolutely not.

110
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:49,963
But we must be realists.
You and I weren't born yesterday.

111
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:53,802
- No, and we didn't die yesterday.
- No. What?

112
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:59,489
300 people did prematurely
as a result of smoking.

113
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,531
100,000 deaths a year at least.

114
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,726
It's appalling,
but you know what the Treasury would say?

115
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:11,245
They'd say that smoking brings in
? billion a year in revenue.

116
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:15,207
- You can't beat the Treasury.
- Not with financial arguments.

117
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,841
But this is a moral argument.

118
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,004
Yes, but even...

119
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:26,451
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
This could be a way to beat the Treasury.

120
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:30,009
- You mean you'll support me?
- You've made your point.

121
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:33,688
We'll give it a try.
I'll even read your report. Again!

122
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:39,442
This could be very interesting.
Thank you very much indeed.

123
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,042
But will you support me?

124
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,488
Yeah, well, not publicly.

125
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:49,647
It would undermine my position, undermine
the argument if I supported you from the start.

126
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,004
I have to be seen as the impartial judge
swayed by the force of the argument.

127
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:57,204
Yes, I see that.

128
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:01,161
But off the record,
I'd like to see this pushed very hard indeed.

129
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,212
Make some speeches on it.
Peter, thank you very much indeed.

130
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:12,164
Thank you for your cigarette paper...
your paper on cigarettes.

131
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,561
- Is this serious?
- What do you mean?

132
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,843
It's always been the practice

133
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:24,325
to discourage anti-smoking speeches
by ministers and not to distribute them.

134
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,446
Well, I want Peter's speeches distributed.
I want everybody to know.

135
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:33,886
Yes, Prime Minister. Do you think you will win
this one? The tobacco lobby is very powerful.

136
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:39,326
Well, some you win, some you lose, Bernard.
This one I shall definitely lose.

137
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,046
Then why?

138
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,206
If you were the Treasury, would you rather do
without ?.5 billion in tax cuts

139
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,728
or ? billion in lost tobacco tax revenue?

140
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,202
- The tax cuts.
- (PHONE RINGS)

141
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,883
Exactly. That's what I want
and that's what I shall get.

142
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,687
- Can Sir Humphrey have a word?
- Of course.

143
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,923
Yes, come in, please.

144
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,322
- Prime Minister...
- Humphrey.

145
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:07,803
Did you have an interesting chat with Dr Thorne?

146
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,732
Yes. He proposed the elimination of smoking.

147
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,371
By a campaign of mass hypnosis perhaps!

148
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:23,453
By raising tobacco taxes sky high
and simultaneously banning all advertising.

149
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:30,689
- I think his position is admirably moral.
- Moral perhaps, but extremely silly.

150
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:34,812
No man in his right mind
could contemplate such a proposal.

151
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,208
I'm contemplating it.

152
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:41,651
Yes, of course, Prime Minister.
Please don't misunderstand me.

153
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:46,807
It is quite right that you should CONTEMPLATE
all proposals that come from your government,

154
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:49,441
but no sane man would ever SUPPORT it.

155
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:53,168
- I'm supporting it.
- And quite right too, Prime Minister.

156
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:58,805
The only problem is that the tax on tobacco is
a major source of revenue for the government.

157
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:01,447
And a major source of death from diseases.

158
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:05,771
Yes, but no definite causative link
has ever been proved, has it?

159
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:08,885
- The statistics...
- You can prove anything with statistics.

160
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,732
- Even the truth.
- Yes... No!

161
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:18,611
It says here, ''Smoking-related diseases
cost the NHS ?65 million a year.''

162
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,202
Yes, but we've been into that.

163
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:26,163
It has been shown that if those extra
100,000 people had lived to a ripe old age,

164
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,565
they would have cost us even more
in pensions and social security

165
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,201
than they did in medical treatment.

166
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,649
So financially speaking, it's unquestionably better

167
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:40,010
that they continue to die at about the present rate.

168
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:45,571
''When cholera killed 30,000 people in 1833,
we got the Public Health Act.

169
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:49,726
''When smog killed 2,500 people in 1952,
we got the Clean Air Act.''

170
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:54,489
A commercial drug kills half a dozen people
and we get it withdrawn from sale.

171
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:59,006
Cigarettes kill 100,000 people a year
and what do we get?

172
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,852
? billion a year.

173
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:06,524
25,000 jobs in the tobacco industry,
a flourishing cigarette export business,

174
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,048
helping our balance of trade,

175
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:13,126
250,000 jobs related to tobacco -
newsagents, packaging, transport...

176
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,804
- These figures are just guesses.
- No, they're government st... They're facts.

177
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:23,967
So your statistics are facts
and my facts are merely statistics?

178
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:28,371
I'm on your side. I'm merely giving you
some arguments you'll encounter.

179
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:32,452
Humphrey, I'm so glad to know
we'll have support such as yours.

180
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:37,084
It will be pointed out that the tobacco
companies are great sponsors of sport.

181
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:41,849
Where would the BBC sports programmes be
if cigarette companies couldn't advert...

182
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,125
couldn't SPONSOR the events that they televise?

183
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,681
We're talking about 100,000 deaths a year.

184
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,489
Yes, but cigarette taxes pay for a third
of the cost of the National Health Service.

185
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:56,850
We're saving many more lives
than we otherwise could

186
00:12:57,013 --> 00:13:01,529
because of those smokers who voluntarily
lay down their lives for their friends.

187
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:05,241
Smokers are national benefactors.

188
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,364
So long as they live!

189
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,684
Not that any definite causal link
has ever been proved.

190
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:17,650
It's time for your next Cabinet committee,
then the Minister of Sport wants an urgent word.

191
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:20,281
- What about?
- Sponsorship.

192
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:25,042
Who tipped him off?
He's one of the tobacco lobby.

193
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,926
A member of YOUR government?

194
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:33,008
Yes, he's Minister for Sport. He has a vested
interest. He's also an MP for Nottingham.

195
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:35,641
Did you tell him? How did he know?

196
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,327
The grapevine perhaps. Prime Minister...

197
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:41,887
Tell the minister I'll see him at 2.30.

198
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:46,524
- With pleasure, Prime Minister.
- Not with pleasure, but I'll see him anyway.

199
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,521
The Minister for Sport, Prime Minister.

200
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,287
Oh, Leslie, my dear fellow. Hi.

201
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,241
Do you mind if I smoke?

202
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,487
Prime Minister, it's about the rumour

203
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:06,726
that you intend to make a personal attack
on the tobacco industry.

204
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,487
- I hadn't heard that rumour.
- It's not true?

205
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,690
The Minister for Health is considering the matter.

206
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,242
There's no smoke without fire.

207
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:19,486
You'd be consulted.
As Minister for Sport, you have an interest.

208
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,684
Never mind sport.

209
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:27,769
There are marginal seats in Bristol, Nottingham,
Glasgow, Basildon and Northern Ireland,

210
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,128
all with tobacco workers.

211
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:34,571
I've got 4,000 tobacco workers
in my constituency. What about my seat?

212
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:37,167
(COUGHS WHEEZILY)

213
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,889
What about your lungs?

214
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,404
My lungs are fine.

215
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:45,366
He doesn't breathe through his seat.

216
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,487
Oh, your seat, I see, I'm sorry.

217
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:54,283
Thank you, Bernard. I see the difficulty,
but if something is right for the country,

218
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,921
surely the government must pursue it.

219
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:01,883
The government must do what's right,
but not if it affects marginal constituencies.

220
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,806
- There is a limit.
- No decision has been taken.

221
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:07,686
For the good of the party, you can't do this.

222
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:11,886
Weren't you a paid consultant
to the British Tobacco Group?

223
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:17,283
Of course, the fact that the BTG
did pay me a small retainer,

224
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,842
it's totally beside the point.

225
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:25,531
They're a very generous corporation with a strong
sense of responsibility to the community.

226
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:28,287
Look at all the money they give to sport!

227
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,961
They just do it to sell more cigarettes.

228
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,966
No, they do it as a service to the community.

229
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:39,805
Oh, that's all right, then. They can go on
giving the money anonymously if they like.

230
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,481
Well, I'm sure they'd be happy to,

231
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:47,124
provided they could publicise the fact
that they were doing it anonymously.

232
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:52,208
Is it true that Peter Thorne is also trying
to change the government health warning?

233
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,892
Is it?

234
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:59,525
He's proposing something like ''Dying of
lung cancer can seriously damage your health''.

235
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,724
It is not true!

236
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:04,361
If we do nothing, in the next ten years,

237
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:07,684
in this country
we'll have one million premature deaths.

238
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:10,361
Yes, but evenly spread.

239
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,247
Not just in marginal constituencies.

240
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:19,808
Listen, Jim, there is no conclusive proof
of any causal link

241
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,123
between smoking and...

242
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,648
(COUGHS)

243
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:29,602
We at the DHSS
are profoundly worried about smoking.

244
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:34,284
And we agree it's our duty to help
the Prime Minister achieve his objective,

245
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:38,844
but with a third of the voters as smokers,
I can't raise taxes too high.

246
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:44,690
The Chancellor won't commit electoral suicide
and the inflationary effect is considerable.

247
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,327
There is a moral principle involved.

248
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,649
Moral principle, yes.

249
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:55,530
We understand the PM's concern. In fact,
we earnestly believe in the moral principle.

250
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,806
But where ? billion of revenue is at stake,

251
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:02,965
I think we should have
to consider very carefully

252
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,647
whether we have the right to indulge ourselves

253
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:09,965
in the rather selfish luxury
of pursuing moral principles.

254
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:15,247
Where would the arts be without tobacco
sponsorship? At the mercy of the Arts Council.

255
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:21,170
Exactly. Then those silly pressure groups
and fanatics like the Royal College of Physicians!

256
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,772
Fanatics!

257
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,925
They want the government
to have a policy on the matter.

258
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,125
It would be different
if the government were a team,

259
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,763
but in fact they're a loose confederation
of warring tribes.

260
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:39,963
If only the PM could meet the tobacco people,
he could see what really nice chaps they were.

261
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:43,290
And genuinely concerned about the health risks.

262
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:49,250
There can't be anything wrong with them. BTG
have an ex-Permanent Secretary on their board.

263
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,446
- And could well have more.
- In the fullness of time.

264
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:58,685
I think we ought to raise some questions
about your minister, Ian.

265
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:02,732
What does he know about the subject?
Peter Thorne is only a doctor.

266
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,407
His sole purpose is keeping people alive!

267
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,604
Must be biased.

268
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:12,244
Seeing your patients die
must emotionally distort your judgement.

269
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:17,168
It's very understandable,
but a great handicap to cool decision-taking.

270
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:20,649
Very true,
but can we find something a bit stronger?

271
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:25,244
Frank, I think the crucial argument
is that we're living in a free country.

272
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:27,927
We must be free to make our own decisions.

273
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:32,086
Government shouldn't be a nursemaid.
We don't want the nanny state.

274
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:33,606
- Very good.
- Excellent.

275
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,924
The only problem is that is also the argument

276
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,847
for legalising the sale
of marijuana, heroin, arsenic and gelignite.

277
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,682
Maybe that's a good idea
if we put a big enough tax on them.

278
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:47,805
- Politically difficult.
- Pity.

279
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,492
Yes.

280
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,246
Got it!

281
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:57,730
When the Prime Minister was
Minister for Administrative Affairs,

282
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:03,331
I used to get him to accompany me on regular
visits to Lord's, Wimbledon and Glyndebourne

283
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,728
as a guest of BTG,

284
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:11,172
so he's thoroughly implicated
in receiving hospitality worth hundreds,

285
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,722
possibly thousands from them.

286
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:18,808
Now, if that were to leak...
shocking though a leak would be...

287
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,885
- Oh, shocking.
- Shocking.

288
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:26,208
It'd be profoundly embarrassing
for the Prime Minister.

289
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,206
I can't think why I didn't think of it before.

290
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,364
Nor can I.

291
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,881
- Well, Bernard.
- Well, Prime Minister.

292
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,653
Very well. Things are going very well indeed.

293
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,844
Oh, good.

294
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,005
I've got the Treasury on the run and the Chancellor.

295
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,641
Is that good? He's in your own government.

296
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:53,841
Of course it's good. They've got to learn
to come to heel and learn to co-operate.

297
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:58,092
- What do you mean, co-operate?
- I mean obey my commands!

298
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,772
I see.

299
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:03,488
That's what ''co-operate'' means
when you're Prime Minister.

300
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:08,283
Why are these tax cuts in your interest?
It's your government too.

301
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:13,283
Bernard, it's simple. Cutting taxes by
?.5 billion is going to win us masses of votes.

302
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:18,322
My ministers are interested in getting money
for their departments, not in supporting me.

303
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:22,281
I'm using my support for Peter Thorne
as leverage on the Treasury.

304
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,212
- Your loyal support?
- Precisely.

305
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:27,807
In order to get THEIR loyal support.

306
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:32,251
After you get the tax cut, you will withdraw
your support from Peter Thorne?

307
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:35,684
- Bernard, how can you be so cynical?
- (PHONE RINGS)

308
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,526
I shall simply rearrange my priorities.

309
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:41,287
Sir Humphrey's waiting to see you outside.

310
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,603
Send him in at once.

311
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:47,766
Yes, Prime Minister. Your word is my co-operation.

312
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:55,004
- Humphrey!
- Prime Minister.

313
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:59,132
- Everything all right?
- Everything is very far from all right.

314
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,848
- What's the trouble?
- Your anti-smoking legislation.

315
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,446
What about it?

316
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:07,650
Notwithstanding the fact that your proposal

317
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:11,488
could encompass certain concomitant benefits
of a peripheral relevance,

318
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:15,646
there is a countervailing consideration
of infinitely superior magnitude,

319
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:19,692
involving your personal complicity
and corroborative malfeasance,

320
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:24,847
with the consequence that the taint and stigma
of your former associations and diversions

321
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:28,767
could irredeemably
and irretrievably invalidate your position

322
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:33,723
and culminate in public revelations
and recriminations of a profoundly embarrassing

323
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,407
and ultimately indefensible character.

324
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,361
Perhaps I could have a pr閏is of that.

325
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:46,402
- There's nicotine on your hands.
- What do you mean?

326
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:50,492
All the hospitality
that we've enjoyed at BTG's expense.

327
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:54,407
Champagne receptions,
the best seats at sporting and cultural events.

328
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,845
- What's the problem?
- The tobacco companies may tell the press.

329
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:04,047
So? I've had drinks at the Soviet embassy.
That doesn't make me a Russian spy.

330
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,687
Oh... Well... Oh.

331
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:11,482
- Does it?
- Well, no.

332
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:14,167
Let them do their worst. Anything else?

333
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,690
Well, Prime Minister,
there is another vital point to bear in mind.

334
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:21,367
A lot of eminent people, influential people

335
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:25,412
argue that such legislation
would be a blow against freedom of choice.

336
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:30,812
Rubbish! I'm not banning smoking. Does every
tax rise represent a blow against freedom?

337
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,481
Well, it depends how big the tax rise is.

338
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,325
Fascinating! Does 20 pence
represent a blow against freedom?

339
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:41,526
- Prime Minister...
- 25 pence? 30 pence? 31?

340
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:46,767
Is something a blow against freedom simply
because it can seriously damage your wealth?

341
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:52,093
I must warn you of the difficulties.
I foresee all sorts of unforeseen problems.

342
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:53,885
Such as?

343
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:57,250
If I could foresee them,
they wouldn't be unforeseen.

344
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:02,132
You just said you COULD foresee them.

345
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:05,285
If we could set up
an inter-departmental committee,

346
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:08,889
a Royal Commission,
perhaps a Treasury Committee...

347
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:12,085
- Don't talk to me about the Treasury!
- Why not?

348
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:16,246
The Treasury are blocking my plans
for a ?.5 billion tax cut.

349
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:20,369
If only they could be more...flexible.

350
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,252
Oh...

351
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:31,324
Well, I don't think they're fully committed
on that other matter yet.

352
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,046
Really?

353
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,762
Absolutely not.
Oh, no, I'm sure they could find a way.

354
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:39,964
Could they?

355
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:44,649
The only stumbling block would be
if your anti-smoking proposals went through,

356
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:48,965
they'd be too busy with those
to find a way to help with the other cuts.

357
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:53,246
Well, of course, my anti-smoking proposals,
important though they are,

358
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:56,962
don't have nearly such a high priority as defence.

359
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,166
Ah.

360
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,441
The Minister of State for Health is here.

361
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:07,607
Prime Minister, if I might have one or two
minutes to make some phone calls. Thank you.

362
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:09,843
Show him in, Bernard.

363
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,330
- Dr Thorne.
- Peter, what can I do for you?

364
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:16,961
I've just had some very exciting news.

365
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:21,809
We've got full backing from the BMA
and eight top scientific and medical colleges.

366
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,244
Marvellous.

367
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:28,965
But your legislation
can't be put through immediately.

368
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:34,725
It is announced as government policy within
three months, with a White Paper in a year.

369
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:40,565
Yes, since we spoke, I've encountered
a few problems. The Treasury, you know.

370
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:44,971
- Can't be anything you didn't know already?
- Yes. I mean no... Well, yes.

371
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,647
Peter, it's not as simple as you think.

372
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:50,281
Jim, I really am serious about this.

373
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:54,969
It's the one really important and worthwhile
thing I believe I can do in politics.

374
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:59,490
If you stall it, I'll have to resign. And say why.

375
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:04,483
Excuse me, Prime Minister. Could Sir Humphrey
see you urgently just for a moment?

376
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,645
- Would you mind waiting outside, Peter?
- Of course.

377
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,288
Prime Minister, it's quite all right.

378
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:18,607
The Treasury have looked at your proposal again
and they can encompass your tax cut,

379
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:22,083
provided no work is needed
on the anti-smoking proposal.

380
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,807
That's fine, but there is another complication.

381
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,441
Peter Thorne is going to resign if I drop it,

382
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:32,129
go to the press and have me condemned
by all the doctors and scientists in Britain.

383
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:33,772
Oh...

384
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,412
Help!

385
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:41,323
You still have that government vacancy
in the Treasury?

386
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:46,365
You mean...? It's a very big promotion,
a very rapid one.

387
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,292
Nevertheless, for a very able minister.

388
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:54,964
Bernard, get Peter back in here and then get on
to the Department of the Environment.

389
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,567
Get Leslie Potts over here at once.

390
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:01,521
Prime Minister, I think I'll just, erm...
If you'll excuse me.

391
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,684
Dr Thorne.

392
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:09,409
Peter, I've just remembered
we still have that vacancy at the Treasury.

393
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:12,087
I've been racking my brains how to fill it,

394
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:15,529
but your work on this paper
has impressed me enormously.

395
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,201
You're not trying to get rid of me?

396
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:21,171
Definitely not. Quite the reverse.

397
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,364
It's a terrific step up.

398
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,962
But thoroughly merited.

399
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:29,131
How can I take it if it means dropping my bill?

400
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,847
Peter, sit down.

401
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,692
Let me be absolutely honest with you.

402
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:42,085
This legislation would have been...would be...
will be very difficult to get through.

403
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,686
The Treasury is the stumbling block,
not the Department of Health.

404
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:50,368
It'll take longer,
but if you were inside learning the ropes,

405
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:55,812
we'd have a much better chance of a watertight,
foolproof Act when it gets to the statute book.

406
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:59,249
- Believe me.
- So my proposals aren't dropped?

407
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,242
Absolutely not.

408
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:06,243
- OK. I'll take the Treasury job.
- Good.

409
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,047
Thanks a lot. Goodbye, Prime Minister.

410
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,526
That leaves us with a vacancy
at the Department of Health. Now...

411
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:21,207
The Minister for Sport is here, Prime Minister.

412
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,282
- Come in.
- Mr Potts!

413
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,207
Leslie! My dear chap.

414
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:32,087
Sit down. Now...

415
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:36,410
How would you like to be Minister of Health?

416
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:44,127
- Me?
- Yes.

417
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:46,212
Well...

418
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,092
It's a considerable promotion.

419
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,483
But thoroughly merited.

420
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:57,327
You're very suitable for the job. You're not
one of the medical lobby like Dr Peter Thorne.

421
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:03,089
Well, of course I can't refuse it.
Thank you, Prime Minister.

422
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,527
Humphrey, meet our new Minister for Health.

423
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:09,048
Oh, congratulations.

424
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:13,803
I don't want the job
if it means attacking the tobacco industry.

425
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:16,004
Ah, but it wouldn't.

426
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,802
You see, Leslie,
we in government have to be realists.

427
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:23,090
I want you to work WITH the tobacco industry.

428
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,767
They're only trying to sort out the problems.

429
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:31,451
They've got huge resources, nice chaps,
caring people and really fabulous employers.

430
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,682
They are really trying to help.

431
00:28:34,853 --> 00:28:38,448
I want you to work with the industry, not against it.

432
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:41,562
- (COUGHS)
- All right?

433
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,244
What did he say?

434
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,881
I think he said, ''Yes, Prime Minister.''
