1
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:43,795
I got some frightful pressure from the American
ambassador at that drinkies do last night.

2
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,351
- Ah.
- They'd heard about my cancelling Trident.

3
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,113
Ah.

4
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,274
The American defence industries
are big contributors to the President.

5
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:58,151
- Ah.
- He said we had a big problem in East Yemen.

6
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,277
Ah?

7
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,872
Stop saying ''ah'' like that, Bernard.
I'm not your doctor.

8
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,079
- I'm sorry.
- What is this big problem?

9
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:11,237
Ah...

10
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,433
- Thank you, Bernard.
- I'll try to find out.

11
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:18,879
- He muttered about St George's Island.
- St George's Island?

12
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:24,030
- Yes. There IS a St George's Island?
- Yes, it's in the Commonwealth.

13
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,039
Ah, I see, yes. THAT St George's Island.

14
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:32,719
- He's afraid Communists might try to grab it.
- What did you say?

15
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,913
- I'd ask the Foreign Office.
- What did he say?

16
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:39,790
The White House thinks
the Foreign Office is full of pinkos.

17
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,993
No, it's not. Well, not full.

18
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:47,757
They don't want the Reds to get
a strategic base like St George's Island.

19
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:52,915
He spoke about putting tariffs on British
exports to the USA and taxing US investment,

20
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:55,231
causing a run on the pound.

21
00:01:55,441 --> 00:02:00,561
Can't you get the Foreign Secretary
to sort it out? After all, they are on our side.

22
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,956
- Who are?
- The Americans.

23
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,959
I thought you meant the Foreign Office.

24
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:11,955
What's the Foreign Office worried about, Dick?
The Foreign Secretary eats out of your hand.

25
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,477
- Oh, yes. Completely house-trained.
- So?

26
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:21,392
The Prime Minister's the problem.
He's starting to mistrust our advice.

27
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:26,436
- He even questioned Foreign Office policy.
- Surely not!

28
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:30,270
There's even a danger
the Cabinet may pursue its own foreign policy.

29
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:34,599
But that's absurd.
The country can't have two foreign policies!

30
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,317
Quite. And the PM's getting far too keen
on keeping the White House happy.

31
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,115
Dear, oh, dear. So, how can I help?

32
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:47,111
There are a couple of things coming up
where he might need guiding.

33
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,274
- One is St George's Island.
- Ah. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

34
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,399
Remind me, would you, Dick?

35
00:02:54,601 --> 00:03:01,200
As you know, it's one of the few islands
in the Indian Ocean to stay in the Commonwealth.

36
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:04,359
Oh, yes, that's right. It's quite democratic.

37
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,950
Yes. Free elections and everything.

38
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,832
But there's a group of Marxist guerrillas
in the mountains. We hear they're planning a coup.

39
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,839
Well, these things will happen.

40
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:20,392
They're not thinking of starting it
on their own. East Yemen is helping.

41
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:25,994
- Isn't that a democracy?
- People's Democratic Republic of East Yemen.

42
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,795
Oh, I see. It's a Communist dictatorship.

43
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,953
And the guerrillas are Soviet-backed?

44
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:37,394
Yes, and Libyan-backed. Obviously, we in
the Foreign Office are staying right out of it.

45
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,478
Obviously.

46
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:43,435
It would only upset
a load of frontline African states.

47
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,280
And we don't want to antagonise the Soviets.

48
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:52,272
Quite. And we've just landed a huge contract
to build a new St George's airport and harbour.

49
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,194
If we back the wrong side, we may lose it.

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,952
We don't mind which side wins,
the democrats or the Marxists?

51
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,550
Why should we? But you see the problem.

52
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:07,511
If the PM gets into one of his ghastly
patriotic Churchillian moods, he may intervene.

53
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,071
All that pro-British,
defending democracy nonsense.

54
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,193
Oh, I know, I know.

55
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:19,395
He must understand that once you start interfering
in the internal squabbles of other countries,

56
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:24,191
you're on a very slippery slope.
Even the Foreign Secretary's grasped that.

57
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,278
Really? So what was the other point?

58
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,679
The Arabs have put down a motion
at the United Nations condemning Israel.

59
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:35,833
- Naturally, we'll vote on the Arab side.
- Naturally.

60
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,233
- But I gather the PM wants us to abstain.
- Surely not! Why?

61
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:46,232
Something about the PLO starting it this time,
faults on both sides. Sentimental nonsense.

62
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,835
Sucking up to the Americans, as always.

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:53,831
Just help him to realise that,
as far as foreign affairs are concerned,

64
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:59,121
his job is to confine himself
to the hospitality and ceremonial role.

65
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:04,111
I'll do my best, but you know what happens
when politicians get into Number 10.

66
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,079
They want their place on the world stage.

67
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,670
People on stages are called actors.

68
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:15,359
All they're required to do is look plausible,
stay sober and say the lines they're given.

69
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:18,200
Some of them try to make up their own lines.

70
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,040
They don't last long.

71
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,193
The American ambassador
had a word with me last night.

72
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,398
- About what?
- What do you know about St George's Island?

73
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,110
What do YOU know about it?

74
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,915
Well, you're the Foreign Secretary, not me!

75
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,990
Is there any danger of a Communist takeover?

76
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,193
- Well, did he say there was?
- He hinted.

77
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:55,515
No. No chance at all. No chance at all.
The Foreign Office would have told me.

78
00:05:55,721 --> 00:06:01,432
- You're sure they always tell you everything?
- Well, everything they think I should know.

79
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:07,034
That's what I'm afraid of. The Americans are
worried and we can't afford to upset them now.

80
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:12,474
- I'm sure we've got everything under control.
- Chamberlain thought Hitler was under control.

81
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:16,594
- Ah, well, Chamberlain.
- Eden thought Nasser was under control.

82
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:21,591
- The F.O. doesn't know what it's doing?
- No, they don't tell us what they're doing!

83
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:26,435
Absurd. They give me a full answer
to any questions I ask.

84
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:29,439
- And the ones you don't ask?
- Such as?

85
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:34,436
- Such as about St George's Island.
- Ah, well, I don't ask those.

86
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:38,634
- Well, just ask them. For me. All right?
- Yes, of course.

87
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:44,398
But once you interfere in other countries' internal
squabbles, you're on a very slippery slope.

88
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,631
Anything else?

89
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:51,915
Yes, I gather we're proposing to vote
against Israel in the UN tonight. Why?

90
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:55,716
- They bombed the PLO.
- The PLO bombed Israel.

91
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:59,277
- But the Israelis dropped more bombs!
- The PLO started it!

92
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:03,918
- No, they didn't.
- It seems to me there are faults on both sides.

93
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:09,036
- Not according to my advice.
- America is worried. They want us to abstain.

94
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:13,439
I don't think we could do that.
The Foreign Office wouldn't wear it.

95
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,429
Are they here to follow our instructions
or are we to follow theirs?

96
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:19,791
Now, don't be silly.

97
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,790
Prime Minister, Sir Humphrey's here.

98
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:28,555
- Prime Minister.
- Humphrey, I'm worried.

99
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,110
Oh, what about, Prime Minister?

100
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:37,636
- About the Americans.
- Well, we're all worried about the Americans.

101
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:43,438
- Foreign affairs are a complicated business.
- That's why we leave it to the Foreign Office.

102
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:47,998
I've got to keep in with the Americans
if I'm to cancel our defence order.

103
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,070
- Ah.
- I gather that they're worried about us.

104
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:56,956
Of course they are,
but I know how to keep in with them.

105
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:00,073
- How?
- Don't cancel the huge defence order.

106
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:04,877
No, Humphrey, I'm determined on that,
but we mustn't upset them in any other way.

107
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,351
The ambassador mentioned St George's Island.

108
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:13,439
- Oh, really?
- What's going on in that part of the world?

109
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,910
What part of the world?

110
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,955
That part. The part where St George's Island is.

111
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,156
What part is that?

112
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:28,718
- I suggest you go and have a look at the map!
- No, I do know, Prime Minister.

113
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:32,231
Good. Then we both know.

114
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:38,877
The White House is worried
it might be taken over by Marxists.

115
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:44,194
- It's not funny, Humphrey.
- No, indeed. Rather touching, really.

116
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:49,355
Prime Minister, once you start interfering
in the internal squabbles of other countries,

117
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,115
you're on a very slippery slope.

118
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,638
- That's what the Foreign Secretary said.
- Extraordinary.

119
00:08:56,841 --> 00:09:01,961
Then there's the U.N. vote on Israel tonight.
The Americans want us to abstain.

120
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:07,633
It's a question of maintaining our relationship
with the Arabs. The power of Islam.

121
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,190
Oil supplies.

122
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,756
I'm talking about what's right and wrong.

123
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,521
Well, don't let the Foreign Office hear you.

124
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:21,074
If you insist on an even-handed approach,
the Foreign Office might agree to abstaining,

125
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:26,235
so long as you authorise our man there
to make a powerful speech attacking Zionism.

126
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,717
Surely we should promote
peace, harmony, goodwill.

127
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,310
Well, it would be most unusual.

128
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:36,872
The U.N. is the accepted forum
for the expression of international hatred.

129
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:43,031
- And defending democracy on St George's?
- Not if it harms us by upsetting our friends.

130
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,278
Britain should not support law and justice?

131
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:52,317
Of course we should. We just shouldn't
let it affect our foreign policy, that's all.

132
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,910
We must fight for the weak against the strong.

133
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:59,239
Then send troops to Afghanistan
to fight the Russians.

134
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:02,001
The Russians are too strong.

135
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,790
What was that about law and justice?

136
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:11,392
I want assurances sent
to the Prime Minister of St George's Island

137
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,870
that Britain will stand by him.

138
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:18,438
- Discuss this with the Foreign Secretary.
- Thank you, Humphrey.

139
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:23,032
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- You've been a great help (!)

140
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:26,795
- Bernard?
- Yes, Prime Minister?

141
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,156
Where exactly is St George's Island?

142
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,158
Um...

143
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:36,677
- Shall we look at the globe?
- Good idea.

144
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,394
- Good afternoon, Luke.
- Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

145
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,756
Now, where is it?

146
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,598
Eh...

147
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:55,754
- It's here, in the Arabian Sea.
- Near the Persian Gulf.

148
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,517
The lifeline of the West. There's Afghanistan,
now under Soviet control.

149
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:03,070
Only 400 miles north of the Arabian Sea.

150
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,234
- If the Soviets ever took Pakistan...
- Which they wouldn't.

151
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:12,395
If they did, they'd control the Persian Gulf,
the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.

152
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:16,156
They've always wanted a ''warm water port''.

153
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:21,355
They wouldn't invade Pakistan. The Americans
have a fleet permanently stationed here.

154
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,115
The Indian Ocean.

155
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,792
Prime Minister,
may I have a word about...home affairs?

156
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:32,873
- Home affairs?
- Yes.

157
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:38,599
- We're discussing foreign affairs.
- No, Prime Minister, it's rather urgent.

158
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:42,589
- Are you all right, Bernard?
- Yes, Prime Minister. Please.

159
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,150
Very well. Excuse me, Luke.

160
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:51,796
- What on earth's the matter?
- I don't want to be disloyal,

161
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,955
but it wasn't a good idea to continue
that conversation in front of Luke. Security.

162
00:11:57,161 --> 00:12:02,474
He's your colleague, one of my private
secretaries. What is MI6 up to...?

163
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,879
- Not that sort of risk. He works for the F.O.
- He works for me.

164
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:12,280
Eh...yes, but he's not only your man
from the Foreign Office,

165
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,878
he's also their man in Number 10.
He's a plant.

166
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,197
Oh. Ah.

167
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,158
Oh.

168
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:24,518
- Do you understand?
- Yes. No!

169
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,519
- The F.O. is keeping something from me?
- Yes.

170
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:35,038
- What?
- I don't know. They're keeping it from me, too.

171
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,596
- Then how do you know?
- I don't know.

172
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:41,151
How do you know if you don't know?!

173
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:46,355
I don't know specifically what, but I do know
they always keep everything from everybody.

174
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:49,081
- It's normal practice.
- Who does know?

175
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,670
May I just clarify the question?

176
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:56,437
You are asking who would know what it is that I
don't know and you don't know but the F.O. know

177
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:01,391
that they keep from you so you don't know and
all we know is there is something we don't know

178
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:07,113
and we want to know, but we don't know what
because we don't know? Is that it?

179
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:13,592
May I clarify? Who knows Foreign Office
secrets apart from the Foreign Office?

180
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,395
Oh, that's easy. Only the Kremlin.

181
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:23,310
This bother about St George's Island
is getting to be a bore.

182
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:27,355
We made the real mistake
giving them their independence.

183
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,155
Wasn't that right? Wind of change and all?

184
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:34,314
Yes, but not that way.
We should have partitioned the island.

185
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,360
Like we did in India, Cyprus and Palestine?
And Ireland?

186
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:43,589
Yes, that was our invariable practice
with the colonies. It always worked.

187
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,190
But didn't partition always lead to civil war?

188
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:52,355
- As in India, Cyprus, Palestine and Ireland.
- Yes, but it kept them busy.

189
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:57,037
Instead of fighting other people,
they fought each other.

190
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:01,519
Yes, rather good. Saved us having a policy.
Cheers.

191
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,319
- Sir Humphrey?
- Yes, Bernard?

192
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:08,279
- Um, Sir Humphrey...
- Yes, Bernard?

193
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,830
- Could I have a word?
- Yes, Bernard?

194
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,390
- With both of you.
- Yes. What about?

195
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,552
- St George's.
- What now?

196
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,514
The PM seems to be completely in the dark.

197
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:23,158
- Good.
- Excellent. Anything else?

198
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,034
I wonder, is there anything he doesn't know?

199
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,630
I hardly know where to begin, Bernard.

200
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:35,037
- No, I mean anything important.
- He has the Foreign Secretary to tell him.

201
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:39,632
- He seems to think HE doesn't know either.
- I should hope not!

202
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:46,159
- Are you implying that he ought to know?
- Well, he IS the Prime Minister.

203
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:51,515
Bernard, it's simply too dangerous to let
politicians become involved with diplomacy.

204
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:57,193
Diplomacy is about surviving until the next
century. Politics is about surviving to Friday!

205
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:02,395
There are 157 independent countries
in the world. We've dealt with them for years.

206
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:05,473
There's hardly an MP who knows anything.

207
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:10,476
Show them a map of the world,
most have a job finding the Isle of Wight.

208
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:13,673
Surely politicians can't be that ignorant?

209
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,190
Very well. Sit down, Bernard.

210
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,353
- Where is the Upper Volta?
- Em...

211
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,513
- What's the capital of Chad?
- Um...

212
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:28,152
- What language do they speak in Mali?
- Em...

213
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:32,070
- Who's the president of Peru?
- Um...

214
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,875
What is the national religion of Cameroon?

215
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,118
- Em...
- Bernard?

216
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,710
You should stand for Parliament.

217
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:48,036
No, what I mean is if it's a democracy,
shouldn't people sort of discuss things a bit?

218
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,153
- Of course. Full discussion.
- And have the facts?

219
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:55,752
Of course not! They don't want them.
Facts complicate things.

220
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:01,314
All the press, the people and their leaders want
to know is who are the goodies and baddies.

221
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:06,800
The interests of Britain nearly always involve
doing deals with people they think are baddies.

222
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:09,879
And not helping the goodies occasionally.

223
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,675
So we avoid discussion of foreign affairs.

224
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,230
Or rather we keep it inside the Foreign Office

225
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:21,033
then we produce one policy for the Foreign
Secretary, which is our considered view.

226
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,756
- No options? No alternatives?
- None.

227
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:29,239
- What if he's not satisfied?
- If pressed, we look at it again.

228
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:33,639
- And come up with a different view?
- Of course not! The same view.

229
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,833
- What if he demands options?
- It's obvious.

230
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:42,871
The F.O. present him with three options,
two of which are, in fact, exactly the same.

231
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,276
And the third is totally unacceptable.

232
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,154
Like bombing Warsaw or invading France.

233
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:53,151
We occasionally encourage the Foreign
Secretary to produce his own policy,

234
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:59,078
then we tell him it will inevitably lead to
World War Three, perhaps within 48 hours.

235
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:04,435
- I see. I'm sorry to appear stupid...
- Oh, perish the thought, Bernard.

236
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:11,400
In my experience, ministers are concerned
about the effect of policy on domestic opinion.

237
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,950
Our system doesn't seem to allow for that.

238
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:18,871
Of course not. We take the global view.
We ask what's best for the world.

239
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,790
Most ministers would ask
what will the ''Daily Mail'' say!

240
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:29,190
We can't have foreign policy made by yobbos
like Fleet Street editors or backbench MPs!

241
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:32,353
- Or Cabinet ministers.
- Or Cabinet ministers.

242
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:36,514
We take the right decisions
and let them sort out the politics.

243
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:41,072
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes? Yes, come in, Mrs Whitmore.

244
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:46,040
- Thank you.
- If the Foreign Secretary won't accept this...?

245
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,835
It's a free country. He can always resign.

246
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,717
How can you treat the PM like this?
After all, St George's IS a democracy!

247
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,912
Not for long.

248
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:00,996
The East Yemen are preparing to invade
in support of the Marxist guerrillas.

249
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,396
- That's awful.
- Yes and no.

250
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:08,635
Moderately bad news for the government
of St George's, but very good for the guerrillas.

251
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:13,835
- What about the islanders?
- Bernard, you're reacting like a politician.

252
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,430
- What are we going to do to help them?
- Nothing.

253
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:22,233
- What if St George's appeals to us?
- We'll give them every support, short of help.

254
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:27,435
- What if the Prime Minister insists?
- Then we follow the four-stage strategy.

255
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:32,197
- What's that?
- Standard F.O. response in a time of crisis.

256
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,353
In stage one we say nothing is going to happen.

257
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:38,871
Stage two, it may happen,
but we should do nothing.

258
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:43,916
Stage three, maybe we should do something,
but there's nothing we CAN do.

259
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:49,115
Stage four, maybe there was something
we could have done, but it's too late now.

260
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,790
Afternoon telegrams, Prime Minister.

261
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:01,670
Thank you, Luke.

262
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:07,397
- Where's Bernard?
- I think he's with Sir Humphrey.

263
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:11,440
- Troop movements in East Yemen?
- It's not significant.

264
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,519
The American ambassador mentioned it.

265
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,315
Really? I'm surprised he'd heard of it.

266
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:21,997
- What are they up to?
- Just preparing a regular raid on West Yemen.

267
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:25,193
- Nothing for us to worry about?
- Nothing at all.

268
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,791
He said something about St George's, too.

269
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,674
Really? Educated man.

270
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:35,476
For an American.

271
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:40,709
- Is there a problem there?
- No, no, no. Just the normal local squabbles.

272
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:45,870
- He was worried about a Communist takeover.
- Americans always are.

273
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,675
Luke! Have you read this?

274
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:53,119
- We voted against Israel in the U.N. last night!
- Yes, Prime Minister.

275
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:57,872
- But I gave express instructions to abstain.
- I think not.

276
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:02,040
I said I felt very strongly
that we should not take sides.

277
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:06,632
- The Foreign Secretary noted your feeling.
- But did nothing about it!

278
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:11,670
With respect, he did. He asked our U.N.
ambassador if we should consider abstaining.

279
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,872
- What did HE do?
- He said no.

280
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:18,438
You mean the Foreign Office
can simply ignore the Prime Minister?!

281
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:23,635
Certainly not, Prime Minister. They take full
account of you when coming to their decision,

282
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:28,591
but events move rapidly. There were important
factors in our relationship with the Arabs

283
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:33,710
that were not known to you when you took your
view. We couldn't get through to you in time.

284
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,719
I am on the phone, you know.

285
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:40,351
It wasn't sufficiently important to wake you.

286
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,473
It was! The White House will do its nut!

287
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:48,994
You could be telephoned before every U.N. vote,
but there are two or three a night.

288
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:53,797
- What can I do to reverse this?
- Nothing. That would be most embarrassing.

289
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,429
Once stated, policy can't be retracted.

290
00:20:57,441 --> 00:21:02,469
- I'd like to talk to the Israeli ambassador.
- I think not, Prime Minister.

291
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:06,479
I want to talk to the Israeli ambassador.

292
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:09,195
If I may say so, it would be rather unwise.

293
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:14,759
Luke! Can you hear me? Watch my lips!
I want to talk to the Israeli ambassador!

294
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,190
Of course, Prime Minister, if that is your wish.

295
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:22,400
I will contact the Foreign Secretary
and then telephone...

296
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,593
I don't want the Foreign Secretary!

297
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:31,273
Prime Minister, it would be most improper to
see him without the Foreign Secretary present.

298
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:35,713
- Why? What do you think I want to talk about?
- Presumably the vote at the U.N.

299
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,516
- That would be most improper.
- Oh.

300
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:44,317
My daughter Lucy wishes to spend
her next long vacation on a kibbutz.

301
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:48,713
Or I should say, as she's
at the University of Sussex, another kibbutz.

302
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:52,516
- I see.
- The ambassador and I were at the LSE.

303
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:58,551
I thought I'd invite him to the flat tonight
for a drink. 6 p.m. See to it, would you, Luke?

304
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:02,754
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:13,751
- Don't be upset, Jim. It happens all the time.
- I told them to abstain.

306
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:18,751
It's well known that in the British Foreign
Office an instruction from the Prime Minister

307
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,711
becomes a request from the Foreign Secretary,
a recommendation from the Minister of State

308
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:27,999
and, finally, a suggestion to the ambassador.
If it ever gets that far.

309
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:30,590
Thank you. L'Chaim.

310
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,558
Cheers.

311
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:36,714
Well, Jim, what are you going to do
about St George's?

312
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:40,078
- You know about that?
- Obviously.

313
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:44,837
- Not a serious problem, is it?
- Your information must be better than mine.

314
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,601
Mine comes from the Foreign Office.

315
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,996
Israeli Intelligence says

316
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:55,359
that East Yemen are going to invade
St George's Island in the next few days.

317
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,358
What?!

318
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:02,311
- So that's the connection.
- Your Foreign Office agreed with East Yemen

319
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:07,077
that they'll make strong diplomatic
representations, but do nothing.

320
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:11,951
- In return, you keep your airport contract.
- There will be uproar!

321
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:14,152
That's only the start.

322
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:19,270
I happen to know that the Americans are going
to support the present St George's government.

323
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,554
- In the U.N...?
- No, in battle. On St George's Island.

324
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:27,117
An airborne division and the Seventh Fleet.

325
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,881
Invading a Commonwealth country?!

326
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:34,034
The Palace will hit the roof. And I'll look ridiculous.

327
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:37,477
- Why didn't they tell me?
- They don't trust you.

328
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:43,153
- Because you trust the Foreign Office.
- Oh, I see. What can I do about it?

329
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:47,957
Jim, you have an airborne battalion
on standby in Germany

330
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,510
that is not now needed for the NATO exercise.

331
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,713
- How do you know?
- I know.

332
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:59,634
Now, if you were to send it to St George's Island,
it would frighten off East Yemen.

333
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,071
They'd never dare invade.

334
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:06,638
Of course, it's not for the Israeli ambassador
to advise the British Prime Minister.

335
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,435
And he wouldn't take your advice anyway.

336
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:17,192
Get me the Foreign Secretary
and the Defence Secretary.

337
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:22,151
I wonder why the Foreign Office didn't
cover themselves. Maybe they did.

338
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:27,111
They gave me several boxes tonight.
I've been through them all except this one.

339
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:29,875
I wonder if this could be it.

340
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,033
''Northern Indian Ocean Situation Report''.

341
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,430
It's 138 pages. It must be it.

342

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

343
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,550
Hello? Yes, Ronnie.

344
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:46,715
I want the president of St George's Island
to invite Britain to send an airborne battalion

345
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,270
on a goodwill visit.

346
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,830
No, just a friendly gesture. Goodwill.

347
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,993
Yes, at once, please. Thank you.

348
00:24:56,001 --> 00:25:00,995
He seemed to think that 800 paratroopers
was an awful lot to send on a goodwill visit.

349
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,713
No, it's just an awful lot of goodwill.

350
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:09,310
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

351
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:14,271
Oh, yes, Paul. You know you have
an airborne battalion on standby in Germany?

352
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:16,830
Never mind how I know.

353
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:21,995
Well, since it's not being used, I want them
to fly straight off to St George's Island.

354
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,959
Sort of between Africa and India.

355
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,274
A goodwill visit. Just showing the flag.

356
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:34,877
They have been invited. Yes. Leave in...six hours.

357
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,475
Yes, an instant goodwill visit.

358
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:41,030
Tell your press office to announce it at once.

359
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,193
No, no, leave me out of it. A routine visit.

360
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:47,159
All right - a routine surprise visit.

361
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:52,992
Well, say they were invited earlier,
but the NATO exercise got in the way.

362
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:58,155
Now they're not needed, they're going.
All right. Nobody knows it's not true.

363
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,915
Press statements aren't delivered under oath.

364
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:05,190
They'll be off at midnight.

365
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:10,873
- There's an airborne battalion in the air.
- Sounds like the right place for it!

366
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:18,673
- I gather it's on its way to St George's.
- Yes, it should land in two hours' time.

367
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:23,477
- Isn't this all rather sudden?
- I had a sudden friendly impulse.

368
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:28,396
- I wanted to spread a little goodwill.
- There's not much goodwill in the F.O.

369
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:32,594
- Really? Why not?
- It might be construed as provocative,

370
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:38,199
sending a fully-armed airborne battalion
like that into an explosive situation.

371
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:42,997
- I thought there was no problem there.
- Eh...well, yes, indeed.

372
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,995
There is no problem, but it's explosive potentially.

373
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:51,797
- Why?
- Moving troops is always potentially explosive.

374
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:56,392
We move them around Salisbury Plain.
Is that potentially explosive?

375
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,320
There are a lot of unexploded shells on...

376
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:05,959
Thank you, Bernard. Do tell me why
the Foreign Office is worried. I'm fascinated.

377
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:10,791
- It's a sensitive part of the world. Unstable.
- They always tell me how stable it is.

378
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:13,879
Well, yes, indeed it is...very,

379
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,636
but it's a sort of...unstable sort of stability.

380
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,159
- Excuse me, Sir Humphrey.
- Yes, Luke.

381
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:27,315
- Foreign Office telegrams.
- Thank you, Luke. Oh, gosh. Rather a lot.

382
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:32,316
Yes, the somewhat unorthodox visit
to St George's has stirred things up.

383
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:36,514
Ah, I see East Yemen
is moving its troops back to base.

384
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,112
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Decided not to invade West Yemen?

385
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:44,313
- So it seems.
- Oh, this is nice.

386
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:48,076
The Americans are delighted by our visit.
That's good.

387
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,994
Excellent, Prime Minister.

388
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:55,956
- They're ready if we want reinforcements.
- Reinforcements of what?

389
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:59,119
Reinforcements of goodwill, Humphrey.

390
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:05,876
May I inquire where the impulse
for this little escapade came from?

391
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:09,869
- Of course you may. It came from Luke.
- Luke?!

392
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,997
From me?

393
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:17,070
It was you who put together that masterly
Northern Indian Ocean Situation Report?

394
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,670
Yes, but it argued for not doing anything.

395
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:22,873
- Come off it, Luke. You can't fool me.
- What?!

396
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,595
I can read between the lines.

397
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:29,754
Some politicians have a feeling for foreign affairs.

398
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:33,357
I knew you meant St George's needed support.

399
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,155
Oh, yes. Well, no, actually.

400
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:39,800
Only in one paragraph on page 107.

401
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,390
It was enough. I can take the hint.

402
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:48,113
I'm giving you full credit. I told the Foreign
Secretary it was your warning sparked it off.

403
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:52,109
No, no, it wasn't! You haven't?!

404
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:57,441
And I don't think I'm giving away any secrets
when I say you are going to be rewarded.

405
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:02,840
- Rewarded?
- Ambassador at a very important embassy.

406
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,555
- Which embassy?
- Tel Aviv.

407
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:10,312
Oh, my God! You can't send me to Israel.
Think about my career.

408
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:13,240
Don't be absurd. It's an honour. Promotion.

409
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,956
They won't want me. I'm on the Arab side.

410
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,910
- I thought you were on OUR side.
- Of course, yes, but...

411
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:27,593
We need somebody like you in Tel Aviv
to explain why we always vote against them.

412
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,559
Don't we, Humphrey?

413
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:32,916
Yes, Prime Minister.
