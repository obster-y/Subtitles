1
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:47,281
Could your political adviser have a word?

2
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:50,036
Yes, of course. Dorothy!

3
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,118
I've hardly seen you since I moved in.

4
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:57,594
I used to be in the office next door to this room.

5
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:02,278
You had me moved to the front of the building,
up three floors, along the corridor,

6
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:06,958
round the corner and four doors
along to the right...next to the photocopier.

7
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,319
- I thought you'd gone on holiday.
- I might as well be!

8
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,911
I came back from my weekend

9
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:18,075
and found my office turned into a waiting room
for ministers and officials.

10
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,234
Humphrey said it was
on your instructions. Was it?

11
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:23,870
No... Well, yes. No. Yes.

12
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:28,672
Humphrey had this plan for rationalisation,
to make better use of the space.

13
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:33,637
The Civil Service have been trying
to get me out of that office for three years!

14
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,514
Why?

15
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:40,312
Because it's in the key strategic position.
It's the best-placed room in the house.

16
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,470
I don't see what difference it makes.

17
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:48,477
This file is the Cabinet Room where we are now.
Through the doors is your private office.

18
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,634
This ruler is the corridor from the front door here

19
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:56,796
and this corridor runs from the Cabinet Room
and connects up to the locked green baize door,

20
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:59,954
on the other side of which is the Cabinet Office.

21
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,114
This coffee cup is the staircase up to your study

22
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:06,115
and this saucer is the gents' loo.

23
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:11,800
And this is...was my office,
and my desk faced out into the lobby

24
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:14,351
and I always kept my door open.

25
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:16,592
What could I see?

26
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:21,711
Well, you could see everyone
who comes in through the front door

27
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:26,478
or from the Cabinet Office
or the Cabinet Room or the private office...

28
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,076
Or up the staircase. Hmm.

29
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,161
And I was opposite the gents' loo.
I have to be opposite the loo!

30
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,716
Have you seen anyone about this?

31
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:42,915
The gents' loo.
Almost everyone in the Cabinet is a man.

32
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:48,076
I could hear everything they said to each other
when they popped out of Cabinet for a pee.

33
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:54,122
I was able to keep the last Prime Minister
fully informed about all their little foibles.

34
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:58,520
- Was it any of his business?
- When they were plotting against him, yes.

35
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:02,271
Bernard, come in here, please.

36
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:05,434
Dorothy, you may have your room back.

37
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:09,950
Bernard, I want you
to put Dorothy back into her old office.

38
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,511
Oh, you mean carry her there?

39
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:18,835
No, I mean return Dorothy
to the waiting room outside here.

40
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:21,920
Before she goes back to HER office, you mean?

41
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:28,353
No, I mean that the waiting room that was once
Dorothy's office will again be Dorothy's office.

42
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,030
But what about the waiting room?

43
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:33,670
Pay attention. Watch my lips move.

44
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:37,558
The waiting room will become Dorothy's office.

45
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:41,357
- Yes, but what about waiting?
- No, Bernard, at once.

46
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:45,032
Yes, Prime Minister,
I realise you mean at once, no waiting,

47
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,558
but I mean where will people wait
if there's no waiting room?

48
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:54,120
The place is full of waiting rooms. There are
state rooms upstairs. There's a lobby there.

49
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,880
Where?

50
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:59,839
Between the ashtray,
the coffee cup and the saucer.

51
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:04,479
Between the ashtray,
the coffee cup and the saucer?

52
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,958
The saucer is the gents' loo. Wake up, Bernard!

53
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:16,878
Hello, Bill. The PM wants Mrs Wainwright
moved back to her old office...

54
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:19,715
What? Withdraw those instructions at once!

55
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:23,477
- But the PM just told me to...
- Withdraw those instructions!

56
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,798
Bill, hold it. I'll get back.

57
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:29,790
- Explain yourself.
- The PM said to move Mrs Wainwright back.

58
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:33,432
- There's nothing to explain.
- There is everything to explain!

59
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:38,551
We've striven for years to get that woman out.
You've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory!

60
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,276
We can't stop the Prime Minister taking advice.

61
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:45,515
We are here to see
that the Prime Minister is not confused.

62
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:52,072
Politicians are simple people, Bernard.
They like simple choices, clear guidance.

63
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:57,475
They don't like doubt - and that impossible
woman makes him doubt everything we tell him!

64
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,673
But he likes her.

65
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,117
Samson liked Delilah.

66
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:06,512
Good morning, dear lady. This is indeed a pleasure.

67
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,470
Hello, Humphrey.
Why aren't you waiting in the waiting room?

68
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,756
Bernard, there is one other thing.

69
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,390
- An alien was admitted yesterday.
- An alien?

70
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:21,881
The Prime Minister's constituency agent was
allowed into Number 10 with no security pass.

71
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:24,437
The police outside recognised him.

72
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:29,318
That is irrelevant. Everyone must have
their Number 10 pass. See to it!

73
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:31,837
Excuse me for butting in, Bernard,

74
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:36,996
but the PRIME MINISTER wants me to make
arrangements with you to move my room back.

75
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:40,990
I've just got to deal with
Sir Humphrey's request about security passes.

76
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,670
- That can wait.
- No, it can't!

77
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:47,630
The Prime Minister wants me
to move back down here right away.

78
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,520
Ah, yes, well, erm...

79
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,074
Prime Minister...

80
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:59,354
Excuse me. I understand you're having second
thoughts about our office reorganisation plan.

81
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,951
Just moving Mrs Wainwright into her old office.

82
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:06,633
No, Prime Minister, the whole reorganisation
depends upon her moving out.

83
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:10,033
- It's only a waiting room.
- A vital square on the board.

84
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:13,791
Well, people can wait in the lobby
or in the staterooms.

85
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:18,518
Some people. But some people must wait where
other people cannot see the people waiting.

86
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:22,960
And people who arrive before other people
must wait where they cannot see other people

87
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:25,636
who arrive after them
being admitted before them.

88
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,761
And people from outside must wait
where they cannot see the people from inside

89
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,959
coming to tell you what the people from outside
want to see you about.

90
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:37,121
And people who arrive when you are
with people they should not know you have seen

91
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:41,275
must wait somewhere until the people
who shouldn't have seen you have seen you.

92
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,434
Sounds like an entire Whitehall farce
going on out there!

93
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:47,998
Prime Minister, Number 10 is a railway junction.

94
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:54,920
It cannot work without its proper components
of sheds and sidings and turntables.

95
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,596
Mrs Wainwright's office is a vital shed.

96
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,754
- I find her advice valuable.
- And of course it is!

97
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,390
And you shall have it on paper.

98
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:07,555
And if you wish for verbal advice,
you can always send for her.

99
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:10,520
The whole Cabinet can give you political advice.

100
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:15,352
They advise me to give more money to
their departments. I need someone on my side.

101
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,030
But I'm on your side.

102
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,994
The whole Civil Service is on your side.

103
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:28,676
680,000 of us.
Surely that's enough to be going on with.

104
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,875
- All giving the same advice.
- Which proves that it must be correct.

105
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,557
Can we return to our original reorganisation plan?

106
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,994
Oh, all right, I suppose so, yes.

107
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:45,480
It's a pleasure to have a decisive
Prime Minister who knows his own mind.

108
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,355
Bernard, find Mrs Wainwright for me, please.

109
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:52,601
- She's here arranging to move rooms.
- Ask her to come back in.

110
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,793
Prime Minister...

111
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,437
Ah...Dorothy!

112
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,154
I...

113
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:11,230
What did you want to talk about?

114
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:16,522
- It's about your office. I changed my mind.
- Has someone else changed it for you?

115
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:19,190
No, we really need that waiting room there.

116
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:20,755
Why?

117
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:25,956
Because if people come to see people
who people didn't know people were coming...

118
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:31,594
That is, if people saw people coming
before people saw them seeing people,

119
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,992
people would see people

120
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,756
and the whole ship would go off the rails.

121
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,039
You see.

122
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:43,080
Did you work all that out for yourself?

123
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:47,514
I can't go into everything personally.
I must rely on advice from my officials.

124
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:52,318
Yes, but Humphrey wants to cut off
all your sources of information and advice,

125
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:56,475
except the Civil Service,
and make himself the only channel for that.

126
00:08:56,642 --> 00:09:00,874
- If you're happy to let him have his own way...
- No, no, no, you're right.

127
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:04,830
You must have your office back.
I need you to be available.

128
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,756
The only trouble is I've just told Humphrey
I've changed my mind.

129
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,511
- Tell him you've changed it back.
- I can't sack Humphrey.

130
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:15,919
- No, but you could clip his wings a bit.
- How?

131
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,353
Stop him coming in and going out
as if he owned the place.

132
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:23,032
- He works here.
- He works in the Cabinet Office!

133
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,352
This is your home.

134
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,555
Oh.

135
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:33,995
And on top of all his other jobs, he's also
Head of the Home Civil Service, isn't he?

136
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:38,593
He's responsible for personnel,
promotions and appointments and so on.

137
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:43,153
Pay and rations are the responsibility
of the Permanent Head of the Treasury.

138
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:47,952
So the Head of the Civil Service's job
is split between Sir Humphrey and Sir Frank.

139
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:52,832
Suppose you were to take away his half
of the job and give it all to Sir Frank?

140
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:56,875
Dorothy...that's brilliant.

141
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,796
Bernard, is Sir Humphrey still with you?

142
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,430
Ask him to come back in, would you?

143
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,401
Brilliant.

144
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,833
Prime Minister?

145
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:18,191
Humphrey, erm... I'm thinking of giving
Mrs Wainwright her old office back after all.

146
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,870
- Prime Minister...
- Yes?

147
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,870
Could we speak privately about this?

148
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,510
You can speak freely in front of me.

149
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,195
Well, I...

150
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:35,599
I need time to see whether it's practicable.

151
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,794
All right. But it had better be.

152
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:41,436
It...might be.

153
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:46,158
Meantime, I have another important matter
to discuss. Would you excuse us?

154
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:48,313
Dear lady...

155
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,918
- Humphrey, sit down.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

156
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:57,916
I've been thinking.
I feel I ought to try and lighten your load.

157
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:02,396
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, there's no need.

158
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:07,392
There is, Humphrey. Apart from everything else,
you're Head of the Civil Service.

159
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:10,116
The Treasury handle pay and rations.

160
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:13,797
You handle promotions and appointments.
It's a bit much.

161
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:17,796
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Hardly takes any time. A doddle.

162
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:22,154
The promotion and appointment
of 680,000 people a doddle?

163
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,398
Well, it's delegated.

164
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:29,995
If it's delegated already, there'll be no
problem about moving it all to the Treasury?

165
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:34,718
No, that's impossible! The Treasury
already have far too much power...work.

166
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,991
Yes, but you see,

167
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:44,156
with you responsible for promotions and
appointments and them for pay and rations,

168
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:48,156
the lines of authority are unclear,
it's a bit unsatisfactory.

169
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,830
Well, I could take over pay and rations too.

170
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:56,560
On top of everything else? Humphrey, I couldn't
allow you to make that sort of sacrifice.

171
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:58,753
It's no trouble at all.

172
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:03,160
You're too noble, Humphrey,
but I can see through your arguments.

173
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:06,597
Can you?

174
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:11,193
You want to sacrifice yourself
in order to spare me worry, don't you?

175
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:13,353
Oh, yes.

176
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:16,992
No, no, no.
It's hardly any... It's no sacrifice at all.

177
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:22,196
Humphrey, the more I think of it, the more
I think you've got a bit too much on your plate.

178
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:27,516
I shouldn't keep you here any longer. You must
have so much work to do in your own office.

179
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:30,754
- You mean...?
- I mean you may now leave.

180
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:36,351
If you're wanted again at Number 10,
you will be sent for.

181
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,911
- You mean when?
- I mean when.

182
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,393
And if.

183
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:46,999
Bernard...

184
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:52,077
Would you ask Sir Frank Gordon from
the Treasury to see me as soon as possible?

185
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:02,997
The Permanent Secretary of the Treasury,
Prime Minister.

186
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:06,274
I don't want Humphrey
putting his head round the door.

187
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:10,236
- I'll do my best.
- That may not be good enough.

188
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:14,196
Dorothy tells me that technically
Humphrey's supposed to phone you

189
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:17,240
before he comes through to Number 10.

190
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,956
Perhaps in theory, but it's just a formality.

191
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:22,511
Good. Humphrey likes formality.

192
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:29,112
Yes, Prime Minister, but it's a custom more
honoured in the breach than in the observance.

193
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:34,555
Must you and Humphrey always express
yourself in this roundabout and pompous way?

194
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:37,714
''More honoured in the breach
than in the observance!''

195
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:42,717
Must you destroy the most beautiful language
in the world, the language of Shakespeare?

196
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,396
That IS Shakespeare, Prime Minister.

197
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,310
I'll give Sir Humphrey your message.

198
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,393
Sit down, Frank.

199
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:58,155
- I wanted to sound you out about something.
- Of course, Prime Minister.

200
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:02,713
I'm wondering if Humphrey hasn't got
rather too much on his plate.

201
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:07,279
- I'm sure he can manage. Tremendously able.
- He's not overstretched?

202
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:10,360
No, got it all under control. No problem there.

203
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:15,801
Because I was wondering, speculating
about his position as Head of the Civil Service.

204
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,561
Ah.

205
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:23,753
It could make some sense if everything
were to be transferred to the Treasury

206
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,914
if you think you could do part of Humphrey's job?

207
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,401
Oh...

208
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:32,230
Yes, that could make a lot of sense.

209
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:35,161
But if, as you say, he's not overstretched...

210
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:37,830
When I say ''not overstretched'',

211
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,393
I was talking in the sense of total,
cumulative loading taken globally,

212
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:47,556
rather than in respect of certain individual
and essentially anomalous responsibilities

213
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:51,237
which are not, logically speaking,
consonant or harmonious

214
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:54,474
with the broad spectrum of intermeshing functions

215
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:58,430
and could be said to place
an excessive burden on the office

216
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:04,120
when considered in relation to the exiguous
advantages of their overall centralisation.

217
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:07,430
You COULD do part of Humphrey's job.

218
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:17,040
Ah, hello. May I speak to Sir Humphrey, please?

219
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:19,796
- Yes, Bernard.
- Oh, hello, Sir Humphrey.

220
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,073
Oh, Sir Humphrey, hello.

221
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,750
- Hello.
- Bernard here.

222
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,078
So I see.

223
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:36,838
- You're just the person I want to talk to.
- Here I am in person. Even better.

224
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,796
Well, yes and no. Erm, Sir Humphrey...

225
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,953
Yes, Bernard?

226
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:47,991
The Prime Minister has asked me
to remind you that it might be more convenient,

227
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:51,279
that is, it might involve you
in less hanging around...

228
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:57,436
..if you were to phone through from the Cabinet
Office before popping over to see us.

229
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:01,555
- It's not inconvenient at all.
- Yes, it is.

230
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:04,600
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

231
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,630
- Is the Prime Minister busy?
- Yes.

232
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,316
- With what?
- Just paperwork.

233
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:18,794
- I'll just have a word with him.
- He's doing his paperwork with somebody.

234
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,430
- He's got somebody with him?
- Yes.

235
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,877
Who? Who, Bernard?

236
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,830
- Permanent Secretary of the Treasury.
- I see.

237
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:31,752
If you want to see the Prime Minister, it is
better to phone and ask. Sir Humphrey, no!

238
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:37,559
If you were to become Head of the Home Civil
Service, would there, do you think, be any...?

239
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:44,561
- Humphrey!
- Prime Minister...

240
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,512
What are you doing here?

241
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,150
I was just wondering if I could be of service.

242
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:53,792
- Didn't Bernard tell you I was in a meeting?
- Yes, he did.

243
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,518
Well, what do you want?

244
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,881
Well, I thought that as it was with one
of my professional colleagues that I might be...

245
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,033
Hello, Frank!

246
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,716
..might be able to make a contribution.

247
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:09,390
I see. No, thank you.

248
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,041
Ah.

249
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:15,478
- Thank you, Humphrey.
- Thank YOU, Prime Minister.

250
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:18,156
This is a private meeting, Humphrey.

251
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:22,878
- Do you want me to shut the door?
- Yes, please.

252
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,553
No, Humphrey.

253
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,958
From the other side.

254
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:32,920
- May one ask why?
- Perhaps I should leave...

255
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:37,001
- Humphrey, please leave now.
- In what sense do you mean ''leave''?

256
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:38,920
Go!

257
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:42,036
Very well, Prime Minister.

258
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:46,758
You too, please, Frank. We'll continue this
on another occasion. Bernard!

259
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,757
Why did you let Sir Humphrey come in
when I told you not to?

260
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:54,436
I couldn't stop him. He's bigger than me.

261
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:00,716
He must be confined to the Cabinet Office.
Lock the communicating door.

262
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:04,198
- He has a key.
- Take his key away from him.

263
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,870
You take his key away from him!

264
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,434
Sorry, but I don't think it's within my power.

265
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,759
I'm giving you the power, Bernard.
I'm authorising you.

266
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,715
But I don't know whether I... I mean...

267
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,881
Crikey!

268
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:22,870
He'll go completely potty.

269
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:25,112
(CHUCKLES)

270
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,600
- It's up to you, Bernard.
- Yes, but...

271
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:31,196
- Freedom, Bernard.
- Yes, but...

272
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,838
- I'm authorising you, Bernard.
- Yes.

273
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:38,239
You alone will have access to the Prime Minister.

274
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,835
But...

275
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:43,159
But me no buts, Bernard... Shakespeare.

276
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:47,954
No, Prime Minister, ''but me no buts'' is circa 1820.

277
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:53,515
Mrs Centlivre used the phrase in 1708,
but it was Scott's employment of it in 1816

278
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:56,190
which made it fashionable.

279
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,556
Shall we keep to the point, please, Bernard?

280
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,236
Yes, Prime Minister. There's only one problem.

281
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:07,680
If I'm to take his key away from him,
what reason can I possibly give?

282
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:11,318
- For God's sake, find a reason!
- Yes! Yes, Prime Minister.

283
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,918
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- Thank me no thankings, Bernard.

284
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:17,081
Hacker.

285
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,753
Hello, Bernard?

286
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:33,712
It's me. I'm coming through to Number 10.
I'd like a word with the Prime Minister.

287
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:37,633
- What did you say?
- I said ''no'', Sir Humphrey.

288
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,833
- No?
- <i>Yes.</i>

289
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:42,675
That's better. I thought you said ''no''.

290
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,396
I did say ''no''. The Prime Minister is busy.

291
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:49,113
- Then I'll come and see YOU.
- I'm busy too.

292
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,153
What?

293
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:56,231
- You do not have permission to come in.
- I'm coming anyway! You little runt!

294
00:19:58,402 --> 00:20:00,870
- He couldn't believe it.
- What did he say?

295
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:05,718
He's coming anyway. He can't come in.
I told Security to take his key from his office.

296
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:10,194
- My God!
- No, Bernard, it's just your boss.

297
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,430
- I'm staggered.
- I'm fairly surprised myself.

298
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:17,601
- How did you get through a solid door?
- Where's my key?

299
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:22,520
The Prime Minister told me to have it removed.

300
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,237
- That's quite correct.
- It's nothing to do with you. Thank you.

301
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:29,758
The Prime Minister does not have the power
to take my key.

302
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:32,436
- It's his house.
- It's a government building.

303
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:38,160
It's his decision who comes into his house.
I don't give my mother-in-law my house key.

304
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,559
I am not the Prime Minister's
mother-in-law, Bernard!

305
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,517
Look, Bernard...

306
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:51,594
- Would you excuse us, dear lady?
- Yes, carry on.

307
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:57,959
Bernard, I don't want us to fall out over this.

308
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:02,075
It's so petty of the Prime Minister.

309
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:07,556
You and I will have to work together for some
years yet, but Prime Ministers come and go.

310
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:12,474
Whereas your career prospects
depend upon those who have the power

311
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:15,998
over promotions and appointments
on a long-term basis.

312
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,395
I must insist you tell me how you came in.

313
00:21:20,522 --> 00:21:23,161
- Sorry.
- You must have a personal key.

314
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:26,075
Now, I insist you hand it over!

315
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:32,031
Well done, Bernard.

316
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:38,832
Hello, is that Security?

317
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:43,473
Change the locks on the door
connecting the Cabinet Office to this house

318
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,872
and bring me all the keys.

319
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,317
Yes, all the keys! At once!

320
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:53,396
Right, well, thank you, gentlemen.

321
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,950
- Oh, Frank!
- Yes?

322
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:03,551
Good meeting with the PM?

323
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,713
Yes, very good.

324
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:08,350
Any particular subject come up?

325
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:11,116
Any particular subject you're interested in?

326
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:13,432
No, not particularly.

327
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:18,479
- He didn't talk about service appointments?
- It may have cropped up.

328
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:21,634
Did he foreshadow
any redistribution of responsibility?

329
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,231
It was a wide-ranging discussion.

330
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,510
Did it move towards any conclusion?

331
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,190
There were arguments on both sides.

332
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,753
Evenly balanced?

333
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:37,312
Perhaps tending slightly more one way
than the other.

334
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:42,675
- But nothing to worry about?
- Nothing for ME to worry about.

335
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:45,831
See you this afternoon.

336
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:58,150
Bernard, I'm coming through to Number 10.

337
00:22:58,362 --> 00:23:00,796
Sir Humphrey, it is not convenient.

338
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:03,072
I'm coming anyway!

339
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:05,676
He thinks he's coming anyway.

340
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:25,356
Open this door! Open this door!

341
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:31,000
You'll pay for this! Open the bloody door!

342
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:05,396
I'm sorry, sir. Do you have an appointment?

343
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:10,074
- I'm Sir Humphrey Appleby.
- I know. Do you have an appointment?

344
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:14,599
- I'm the Cabinet Secretary!
- Yes, sir. Do you have an appointment?

345
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:17,993
I don't need an appointment. I've got a pass!

346
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:20,272
May I see it, sir?

347
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,833
If you insist.

348
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:30,277
All right now?

349
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:34,037
No, sir, that's a Cabinet Office pass,
not a Number 10 pass.

350
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:38,593
- You know me, damn it!
- There's a new top security instruction, sir.

351
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:43,961
No one may enter without a Number 10 pass
unless they're on the daily list.

352
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:47,281
Unless Mr Bernard Woolley gives permission.

353
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:51,236
- Would you like me to phone Mr Woolley, sir?
- Yes... No.

354
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:54,877
- Yes.
- Was that a ''yes'', sir?

355
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,361
Yes.

356
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:05,395
I have Sir Humphrey Appleby here
wishing to enter by the front door.

357
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:08,360
Ask Mr Woolley if he may be admitted.

358
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:10,917
(RADIO CRACKLES)

359
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:19,681
They can't find Mr Woolley at the moment
and he left no word, so we can't let you in.

360
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:48,791
Oh, look, it's Humphrey!

361
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:01,710
(ALARM GOES OFF)

362
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:09,997
- Turn that noise off!
- It's all right. It's only Sir Humphrey.

363
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:13,359
(PRIME MINISTER) It's all right. I'm perfectly safe!

364
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,997
(ALARM STOPS)

365
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:23,279
Sir Humphrey, to what do we owe this pleasure?

366
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,274
Prime Minister, I must protest
in the strongest possible terms...

367
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:33,955
my profound opposition
to a newly instituted practice

368
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:37,239
which imposes severe and intolerable restrictions

369
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:41,395
upon the ingress and egress
of senior members of the hierarchy

370
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:45,953
which will, should the current
deplorable innovation be perpetuated,

371
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:49,512
precipitate a constriction
of the channels of communication

372
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:53,800
and culminate in organisational atrophy
and administrative paralysis

373
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:58,956
which will render impossible the coherent
discharge of the function of government

374
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:03,638
within Her Majesty's United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

375
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:08,230
You mean you've lost your key?

376
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:14,478
Prime Minister, I must insist upon a new one.

377
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:19,676
In due course, Humphrey. At the appropriate
juncture. In the fullness of time.

378
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:26,234
Meanwhile, we have another important, more
urgent decision to make about Dorothy's office.

379
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:29,434
- Quite.
- Surely that can wait.

380
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:32,361
It must be resolved now, one way or the other.

381
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:35,116
It's like the question of the key really.

382
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:38,116
I'd be interested to hear your views.

383
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,796
They are really the KEY to the problem.

384
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:44,073
What do you think?

385
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:45,755
Well, I...

386
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:52,316
I think perhaps on reflection that Mrs Wainwright
does need to be nearer this room.

387
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,670
So we'll move her back, shall we?

388
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:57,641
Yes.

389
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,593
At once?

390
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,320
Yes.

391
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,798
Splendid. Bernard, do you have a spare key?

392
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:15,957
Prime Minister...

393
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:21,318
There is...one other question, Prime Minister.

394
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:27,516
May one enquire who is to be
Head of the Home Civil Service?

395
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:29,713
Why, you, Humphrey.

396
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,873
Or possibly Frank.

397
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:35,876
Or perhaps both. I haven't decided yet.

398
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:39,036
But whatever happens, it's my decision.

399
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,993
Isn't it, Humphrey?

400
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:45,036
Yes, Prime Minister.
