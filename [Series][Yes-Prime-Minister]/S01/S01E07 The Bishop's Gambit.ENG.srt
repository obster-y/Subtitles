00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,870
<i>(TV) Growing concern for Fiona McGregor,
<i>the nurse held in the Gulf state of Kumran</i>

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,469
<i>for alleged possession of a bottle of whisky.</i>

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,475
<i>Her sentence of 10 years' imprisonment</i>
<i>and 40 lashes is awaiting confirmation.</i>

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,674
<i>Today, her mother, accompanied by her MP,</i>
<i>Stuart Gordon, and a group of sympathisers,</i>

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,630
<i>took a petition to the Kumran embassy,</i>
<i>but the Kumrani's refused to accept it.</i>

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,079
<i>The Foreign Secretary described the incident</i>
<i>as regrettable, but no action is planned.</i>

7
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,669
Turn it off, Bernard.

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,509
This is very worrying.
There's a lot of public sympathy.

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,314
I'm sure the Foreign Secretary will advise you.

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,474
- He advises me to do nothing.
- I'm sure that's good advice.

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,069
If we do nothing, we look heartless. And feeble.

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,473
It doesn't do the government any good to look
heartless and feeble simultaneously. Bernard?

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,879
Perhaps you could arrange it so you only look
heartless and feeble alternately.

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,870
- Humphrey, we must do something.
- The Kumranis are good friends of Britain.

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,830
They placed a huge defence contract with us,
they tell us about the Soviets in Iraq,

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,232
they even sabotage OPEC agreements for us.
We can't afford to upset them.

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,230
I know, but a British national is facing
a barbaric punishment for a trivial offence.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,678
The Foreign Office is there
to protect British nationals.

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,316
- To protect British interests.
- It's not in her interest to be flogged.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,718
- It's not in ours to prevent it.
- This could hurt the government very badly.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,555
Well, I understand that tomorrow the Foreign
Secretary will deliver a strong note of protest.

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,958
- Why can't he do it now?
- We haven't got their agreement yet.

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,319
We're seeing the ambassador privately now.
Once they approve the wording, we hand it over.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,995
- Then we'll have done all we can.
- Very heartless.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,589
It's safer to be heartless than mindless.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,639
History is the triumph of the heartless
over the mindless.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,437
- The Cabinet will never agree to this policy.
- The F.O. never expect that for their policies.

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,238
That's why they never fully explain them.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,190
- Even to the Foreign Secretary?
- Especially not to the Foreign Secretary.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,229
All that the Foreign Office requires
is that the Cabinet agree to their decisions

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,712
once they've been taken.
Will that be all? I have a dinner engagement.

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,710
- Yes, I suppose so.
- It's time to get ready for the reception.

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,270
- Oh, who's coming?
- The synod of the Church of England.

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,829
There's a vacancy in Bury St Edmunds.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,913
- They come here when a bishopric is vacant.
- Why?

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,272
To lobby. So you don't choose the wrong name.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,871
- How should I know which one to choose?
- It's like any Civil Service option.

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,429
It will be a conjuring trick.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,993
Take any card, you always end up
with the card the magician forced you to take.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,954
- Suppose I don't take it?
- You will.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,151
Who are these cards?

42
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,478
With the Church, you usually get the choice
of a knave or a queen.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,197
We do appreciate you dining at the college.

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,353
Always a pleasure to dine with old friends.
Thank you, Master.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,914
Humphrey, I'll be retiring in four or five years.
Isn't that roughly when you retire?

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,553
Yes.

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,437
The Bursar and I think you could be just
the chap to succeed me as Master of Ballie.

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,392
Really?

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,989
But there is one obstacle. The Dean.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,551
- Why is he an obstacle?
- He says you're too clever by half.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,669
I should have thought that at Oxford to be
called clever might be rather a compliment.

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,475
- He also says you're smug.
- Thank you, Bursar.

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,430
Well, you've got a lot to be smug about.
If I had ?5,000 a year,

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,398
a knighthood, an index-linked pension,

55
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,350
and a bunch of politicians to take the blame
for all my mistakes, I'd be pretty smug myself!

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,270
The Dean is paranoid that we're intriguing
in this matter behind his back.

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,838
That is why we decided to...discuss it
with you while he's away.

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,598
Quite.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,590
The only way you'll become Master of Baillie
is if we can dump the Dean.

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,753
- But how?
- It isn't easy. He's a lazy devil.

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,514
He only has to do four hours' work a week.

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,071
Give one lecture and a couple of tutorials
and he's got tenure for life!

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,277
Only two interests - cricket and steam engines.

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,597
Never reads a new book, thinks a new thought.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,394
So being an Oxford don is the perfect job.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,990
So what would get him away from Baillie?

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,714
- Only a bishopric.
- A bishopric?

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,835
We wondered about Bury St Edmunds.
That's up for grabs, isn't it?

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,238
Yes, a very agreeable diocese.
It has a seat in the Lords.

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,549
The Dean would like that. His third hobby
is sucking up to the aristocracy.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,228
Naturally. Well, it's not up to me at all.

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,313
- The Church wants to maintain the balance.
- What balance?

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,910
Between those who believe in God
and those who don't.

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,998
Is there anyone in the Church who doesn't?

75
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,589
Oh, yes. Most of the bishops.

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,437
But, in any case, Bury St Edmunds is all sewn up.
Canon Stanford is getting the job.

77
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,279
We thought the Prime Minister had to choose.

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,278
But they gave an impossible second candidate.

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,195
In any case, the Dean hasn't done
enough public service to qualify.

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,868
Are any other dioceses coming free?

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,469
Well, it doesn't happen very often.

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,236
The older appointees don't have to retire at 60.
Bishops tend to have long lives.

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,076
Apparently the Lord isn't all that keen
for them to join Him.

84
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,910
What sort of public service
did you have in mind for the Dean?

85
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,114
Well, why don't you get the bishop
to send him to Kumran,

86
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,670
to try to intercede on behalf of that nurse?

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,231
The Arabs love him
because he's an expert in Islamic studies.

88
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,439
He'd love the Arabs. Either way, we can't lose.

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,835
That's right.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,278
- If he fails, at least he's tried.
- If he succeeds, he's a hero.

91
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,519
And if he doesn't come back, he won't be missed.

92
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,314
No, it's such an awful country.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,315
They cut people's hands off and women
get stoned when they commit adultery.

94
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,559
Unlike Britain where they commit adultery
when they get stoned!

95
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,393
He may even come back with a few parts missing!

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,992
Look, no hands!

97
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,629
Sorry to be so hesitant, Peter.
I've never appointed a bishop before.

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,038
Er, recommended the appointment
to the sovereign, Prime Minister.

99
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,869
Yes. Tell me about Canon Stanford.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,470
Well, Mike is very highly thought of.
He's a modernist.

101
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,234
- Modernist?
- A theological term.

102
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,434
It seems that he accepts that some events
described in the Bible are not literally true.

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,194
He sees them as metaphors, myths or legends.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,319
He's interested in their spiritual
and philosophical truth.

105
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,116
He doesn't believe the world was made
in seven days and Eve came out of Adam's rib?

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,598
- Precisely.
- Sounds very sensible. Anything else?

107
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,716
He went to Winchester and New College,
Oxford, and his name is first on the list.

108
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,310
- Sounds good.
- And he has an eminently suitable wife.

109
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,789
Devout, full of good works?

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,676
No, I mean she's the daughter
of the Earl of Chichester.

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,236
I see. And what about the second?

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,954
Well, second is Doctor Paul Harvey.

113
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,912
And?

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,510
- He's an admirable man.
- But?

115
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,518
It's your choice, of course,

116
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,549
but there's a suspicion
he tends towards disestablishmentarianism.

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,557
Oh.

118
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,997
What?

119
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,636
The view that the Church of England
shouldn't be part of the state.

120
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,191
Some people feel it should be separate,
like Methodists or Catholics.

121
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,797
They think ordinary people feel the established
church is a club for the ruling classes.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,719
Sounds a good man.

123
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,913
Well, it's entirely up to you,
of course, Prime Minister,

124
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,074
but I suspect Her Majesty might be a little
surprised if you asked her to appoint a man

125
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,836
who'd make her break her coronation vows
to defend the Church.

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,236
- Why's he on the list, then?
- Well, he's not quite a disestablishmentarian.

127
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,392
But that's the way his mind seems to be moving.

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,833
I see. So I'm being asked to choose
Mike Stanford or Mike Stanford?

129
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,715
The Commission is offering you
the two names which emerged.

130
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,472
- Was there an open election?
- No. Bishops are in the apostolic succession.

131
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,672
- What's that?
- It's God's will.

132
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,836
When Judas Iscariot blotted his copybook,
he was replaced. They let the Holy Ghost decide.

133
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,753
- How did he make his views known?
- By drawing lots.

134
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,918
Couldn't we let the Holy Ghost decide now?

135
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,114
No one's confident the Holy Ghost would know
what makes a good Church of England bishop.

136
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,478
Sir Humphrey is due here now.
Could we continue tomorrow?

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,234
Not at all. Thank you, Prime Minister.

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,997
Prime Minister, appointing Canon Stanford may
be an own goal. May I get his career details?

139
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,153
- Yes, please do.
- And I'll send Sir Humphrey in.

140
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,399
- Bernard. Prime Minister.
- Ah, Humphrey. Sherry?

141
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,795
Yes, thank you.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,798
What's a modernist in the Church of England?

143
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,351
Ah, well, the word ''modernist''
is code for non-believer.

144
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,352
- You mean an atheist?
- No, no.

145
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,513
An atheist couldn't continue to draw his stipend,

146
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,276
so when they stop believing in God
they call themselves modernists.

147
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,069
How could the Church of England suggest
an atheist as bishop?

148
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,910
The Church of England is primarily
a social organisation, not religious.

149
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,113
- Is it?
- Part of the rich social fabric of the country.

150
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,274
Bishops need to be the sort of chaps who speak
properly, know which knife and fork to use.

151
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,034
The sort of people one can look up to.

152
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,870
- So Canon Stanford's wife's eminently suitable?
- Of course. Cheers.

153
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,033
- Is there really no other candidate?
- Well, not really.

154
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,911
- There were better jobs available recently.
- What's better than a bishop? A rook?

155
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,875
Very droll.

156
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,475
No, Dean of Windsor is a better job.
Or Westminster.

157
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,279
It enables one to be on better terms
with the Royals.

158
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,791
So being a bishop is just a matter of status?
Dressing up in cassocks and gaiters.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,596
Yes, though gaiters are now only worn
at significant religious events

160
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
like the Royal garden party.

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,990
- Why?
- The Church is trying to be more relevant.

162
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,550
- To God?
- No, of course not.

163
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,553
I meant relevant in sociological terms.

164
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,596
So the ideal candidate in the Church's view is
a cross between a socialite and a socialist?

165
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,191
- Precisely.
- May I give you Canon Stanford's details?

166
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,393
- Please do.
- He was chaplain to the Bishop of Sheffield.

167
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,350
He moved on to be the diocesan advisor
on ethnic communities and social responsibility.

168
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,117
He organised conferences on inter-faith interface
and between Christians and Marxists,

169
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,353
and between Christians
and the women of Greenham Common.

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,554
He was chaplain at the University of Essex,
vice-principal at a theological college

171
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,748
and is now secretary to the Disarmament
Committee of the Council of Churches.

172
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,316
Has he ever been an ordinary vicar of a parish?

173
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,548
Good heavens, no. Clergymen who want
to be bishops try to avoid pastoral work.

174
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,309
So you're saying he's a political troublemaker?

175
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,913
No, but he could be a thorn in your side
on strikes, public expenditure on welfare,

176
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,674
inner cities, unemployment, defence.

177
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,436
It's interesting that nowadays
politicians want to talk about moral issues

178
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,239
and bishops want to talk politics.

179
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,149
And he'd speak with the authority of a bishop
and from the Lords.

180
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,749
He designed a new church in South London

181
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,914
with places for dispensing orange juice,
family planning and organising demos...

182
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,358
- But no place for Holy Communion.
- Are you serious?

183
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,190
- Well, there was a dual-purpose hall.
- And the Church approved this?

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,359
- Of course. The Church is run by theologians.
- So?

185
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,588
Well, theology is a device for enabling
agnostics to stay within the Church.

186
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,792
I don't want Stanford. What am I to do?

187
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,870
You could turn both candidates down,
but that would be exceptional and not advised.

188
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,359
Even though one wants God out of the Church
of England and the other wants the Queen out?

189
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,156
- The Queen is inseparable from the Church.
- What about God?

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,310
I think he's what's called an optional extra.

191
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,398
Bernard's on his way up.
Any more news about that nurse?

192
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,394
- No, not really.
- Can't the Foreign Office do something?

193
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,390
The Foreign Office is there
to explain why things can't be done.

194
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,949
This could damage us very badly.

195
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,477
All the Foreign Office does is shrug
and say we mustn't upset the Kumranis.

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,752
- Must be ghastly for her.
- Who?

197
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,996
Oh, that nurse. Yes.

198
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,796
- You don't care about her either.
- Oh, Annie.

199
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,511
- You're only worried about your popularity.
- That's not true.

200
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,280
Sorry, Prime Minister. It's rather important.

201
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,433
The Bishop of Banbury
and the Church Missionary Society

202
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,752
are sending the Dean of Baillie College
to Kumran on a mercy mission.

203
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,351
- An Oxford don? Why?
- He's an expert on Islam.

204
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,273
It's a faith to faith meeting.

205
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,031
All right. Tell the Foreign Office
I support their moves to support him.

206
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,834
No, the Foreign Office want you to stop it.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,869
They say it's a futile gesture which will impair
our relationship with a friendly country.

208
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,958
But I think it's a good idea. Don't you, Annie?

209
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,551
- You mean it might save the nurse?
- Er, yes, that too.

210
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,711
Principally. All right, tell them to go ahead.

211
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,593
Oh, Lambeth Palace want to know
if you've decided about Bury St Edmunds.

212
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,796
- All right, Bernard. Thank you.
- Good night.

213
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,349
What's happening in Bury St Edmunds?

214
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,269
- I've got to choose a bishop.
- That's ridiculous!

215
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,995
- Why?
- You're not exactly religious.

216
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,749
I'm Prime Minister.
Religion has nothing to do with it.

217
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,349
- To do with bishops?!
- Not really.

218
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,318
They're just managers in fancy dress.

219
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,197
The Church of England has over 172,000 acres
of land, thousands of tenants,

220
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,549
leaseholds, property and investments
worth a total of ?.6 billion.

221
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,109
The ideal bishop is a corporate executive.

222
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,558
A sort of merchant banker,
personnel manager and estate agent.

223
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,275
I'd prefer you to choose a man of God.

224
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,474
They offered me one of those, but he wants
to turn the Church into a religious movement.

225
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,871
- They're trying to force a modernist on me.
- Marxist or atheist?

226
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,878
Both. Doesn't matter about the atheist bit,

227
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,034
but being a Marxist could cause me a lot
of trouble once he's in the House of Lords.

228
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,630
- Can't you turn him down?
- It would look political.

229
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,873
- You said the Church IS political.
- But it mustn't look it.

230
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,071
I see.

231
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,631
- Why not turn him down on religious grounds?
- How do you mean?

232
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,758
- Does he believe in Heaven and Hell?
- Of course not.

233
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,715
- The virgin birth? The resurrection?
- No, nothing like that.

234
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,311
- Isn't that enough?
- Annie, you're brilliant!

235
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,473
I'll reject both candidates
and force them to submit another.

236
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,269
I really want a candidate
who'll get on with everybody.

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,439
- Someone without strong views on anything?
- Yes.

238
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,998
It might help if he were inclined towards
Christianity. That wouldn't do any real harm.

239
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,878
So what you need is a sort of closet Christian.

240
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,878
Exactly. Thank you, darling.

241
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,518
<i>The Six 0'Clock News from the BBC,</i>
<i>with Sue Lawley and Nicholas Witchell.</i>

242
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,196
<i>Good evening. News is just coming in</i>
<i>that after two weeks in Kumran</i>

243
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,629
<i>the Dean of Baillie College has succeeded</i>
<i>in obtaining the release of Fiona McGregor,</i>

244
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,310
<i>the British nurse held there in prison.</i>

245
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,514
<i>She was awaiting a sentence of 40 lashes</i>
<i>for possessing a bottle of whisky.</i>

246
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,073
<i>She and the Dean are expected back in England</i>
<i>tomorrow. Now for the rest of the news.</i>

247
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,629
<i>The pound had another bad day...</i>

248
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,556
So it's true. I can't believe it.

249
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,355
- It's a disaster.
- Disaster!

250
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,597
Whose idea was it to send him to Kumran?

251
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,031
Eh, can't imagine. Bishop of Banbury perhaps?

252
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,950
- We had the situation under control.
- Yes, of course you did.

253
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,349
We made our protest. The nurse would have
been quietly flogged and stuffed in some jail.

254
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,154
Within a couple of weeks, the press would forget.

255
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,353
- Still, no real damage done.
- There is to the Foreign Office.

256
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,310
We've almost got agreement to set up
a signals listening post in Kumran.

257
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,349
We said we wouldn't make a fuss if they signed.
We've lost our best bargaining counter.

258
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,633
You could find another nurse
and plant some Scotch on her!

259
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,834
- I don't think we could do that.
- No. No, it wouldn't be right.

260
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,629
No, it's too dangerous.

261
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,590
Still, at least it's got
that nurse's ghastly mother off my back.

262
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,993
She's been writing and phoning and telling
the press that we haven't been doing anything.

263
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,193
- Extraordinary.
- And the press have taken her part.

264
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,114
- Going on about being more patriotic!
- Extraordinary.

265
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,917
They've said a lot of unpleasant things,
but we've never been accused of patriotism!

266
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,399
Sometimes I can't believe the newspapers'
abject ignorance of diplomatic realities.

267
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,075
But we may have a problem with the PM now.

268
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,078
Because we advised him against this?

269
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,711
Because the Foreign Secretary said
it was impossible to get her released!

270
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,199
And we were right! If we'd left it to the
Foreign Office, it would have been impossible.

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,394
You see what will happen now? The press will
say the Church succeeds where the F.O. fails.

272
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,156
They'll dig out all the old cuttings
about ambassadors' Rolls Royces,

273
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,190
? million embassies, school fees at Eton paid
for by the taxpayer and what does Britain get?

274
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,995
- Don't. I know what we'll do.
- What?

275
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,473
We'll tell the press that it was the Prime
Minister's initiative to send the Dean.

276
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,195
Good idea. The PM will enjoy taking the credit.

277
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,757
There's no danger the PM will deny it
because it isn't true?

278
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,758
None at all.

279
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,196
And then for the Sundays we'll leak the idea
that the Foreign Office suggested it to him

280
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,794
when the diplomatic channels were blocked.

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,790
Perfect. Nobody gets the blame
and everybody gets the credit.

282
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,669
- Except the person who really thought it up.
- I don't mind.

283
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,232
- Em...
- (TELEPHONE RINGS)

284
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,393
I don't mind that he doesn't get the credit.
Excuse me.

285
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,949
Hello? Oh, put him on.

286
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,917
Oh, hello, Master.

287
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,155
Have you seen the television news? Splendid!

288
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,909
- Yes, absolutely splendid.
- This could help our friend, eh?

289
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,955
- Certainly could.
- How long until a bishopric falls vacant?

290
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,754
Well, there's no time like the present.

291
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,517
I think the battle of Bury St Edmunds
is not over yet. There have been developments.

292
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,275
- (TELEPHONE RINGS)
- Excuse me.

293
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,910
Hello? Yes, ask him to come in. Thank you.

294
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,991
I think we can still get the Dean
up to the starting gate.

295
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,754
As a late entry. Just leave it to me.

296
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,071
All right. Bye, Master. Bye-bye.

297
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,669
Ah, come in, Peter.

298
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,472
I understand there's a meeting of the Crown
Appointments Commission in the morning?

299
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,673
Yes, they are aware
that a further candidate is required

300
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,274
since the PM saw fit to break with tradition.

301
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,631
By insisting on a bishop who is a believer?

302
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,437
There is one possible candidate, Steven
Soames, but we've saved him up for years.

303
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,160
- We'd rather offer him Truro.
- Why?

304
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,353
Well, Truro is... How shall I put it? Very remote.

305
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,390
It is to the Church what the Vehicle Licensing
Centre in Swansea is to the Civil Service.

306
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,272
Yes.

307
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,077
- Soames has been waiting for years.
- Long time, no see.

308
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,669
Oh, very droll, Humphrey.

309
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,396
Yes, he is a bit of a nuisance.
He keeps on about our duty to God.

310
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,350
We rather wanted him out of the way.
''Long time, no see''!

311
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,036
Yes, but if the PM wants a religious bishop,
he's the only candidate.

312
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,834
He sounds fine, but there is one little snag.

313
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,993
- The PM wants you to put up two more names.
- Two?

314
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,794
You must give the PM the feeling of a choice.

315
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,192
You need a second candidate
who is plausible, but unacceptable.

316
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,997
- I can't think who and the meeting's so soon.
- Why not the Dean of Baillie College?

317
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,115
- I agree he is impossible, but not plausible.
- Why not?

318
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,832
He's a crank! He's unbelievably vain
and hopelessly incompetent.

319
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,034
But the PM appoints people who are vain
and incompetent - look at the Cabinet.

320
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,589
And the Dean's just had good publicity.

321
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,234
Isn't there a danger he'll get in?

322
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,230
Not the slightest. The PM has stated
that he wants a devout Christian.

323
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,791
The Dean only believes in Islam,
steam engines and the MCC.

324
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,670
In fact, some smart aleck once asked him
on TV if he knew what the Bible was.

325
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,874
- And did he?
- He said it's a Christian version of the Koran.

326
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,437
''Jim's Dean saves Fiona from lash''!

327
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,029
- What about that?
- Excellent.

328
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,796
- ''Prime Minister's envoy secures release''.
- Excellent, Prime Minister.

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,470
- ''Angel of mercy was sent by PM''!
- Excellent!

330
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,798
I was given full credit on the news.
I suppose it was me.

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,150
It must have been.

332
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,229
After all, I stopped the Foreign Office
from stopping him, which is the same thing.

333
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,356
- Too late to change it now.
- I wonder why they gave me the credit, though.

334
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,270
Well, they couldn't take it themselves.
This looks like a government achievement.

335
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,755
There's even a leader.

336
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,391
''It does the PM great credit that he has not
been bound by the shackles of diplomacy.

337
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,351
''The Kumran aff...'' This IS important.

338
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,310
Yes, but the Palace is waiting for your
recommendation for Bury St Edmunds.

339
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,835
The two names were in your box.

340
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,838
I thought Steven Soames sounded right.

341
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,710
The Dean of Baillie did a very good job,
but I gather he's rather eccentric.

342
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,516
I'm sure that Soames is the choice
the Commissioners are hoping you make.

343
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,917
Oh? Why? What's wrong with him?

344
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,112
Well, I have heard say that he's an extremist.

345
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,996
- You mean he believes in God?
- He's very religious.

346
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,555
That's all right for a bishop, isn't it?

347
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,151
He tends to raise issues
that governments would prefer not to be raised.

348
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,314
He's a trenchant critic of abortion,
contraception, sex education, pornography,

349
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,756
Sunday trading, easy divorce
and bad language on TV.

350
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,351
- Oh.
- He'd be likely to challenge government policy.

351
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,350
But these are subjects on which the government
is hoping to have no policy.

352
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,198
Our policy is not to have a policy.

353
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,632
Well, quite. He's against your no-policy policy.

354
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,674
He will demand that you ban abortion,
Sunday trading...

355
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,189
Thank you. I get the picture.

356
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,154
- He's also against oppression in Africa.
- So are we.

357
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,239
But he's against it
from black AND white governments.

358
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,432
Oh. You mean he's a racist?

359
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,189
But you can choose him if you like.

360
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,233
I can't turn down another two names.

361
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,034
Well, there is always the Dean of Baillie.

362
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,236
He's not really up to it, is he? I gather he's
lazy, vain and uninterested in Christianity.

363
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,829
But he's not AGAINST it!

364
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,436
I think he would make
a thoroughly suitable British bishop.

365
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,878
Cricket, steam engines
and a complete ignorance of theology.

366
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,789
He's never had an ordinary church job.
He's been at Oxford.

367
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,719
- But he did well in Kumran.
- Yes.

368
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,040
I gather he's thinking of telling the press
that the Kumran visit wasn't your idea.

369
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,671
- What?!
- He's thinking of telling the press...

370
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,953
Yes, yes, I heard what you said.
He can't say that!

371
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,075
I gather he has a letter from the Bishop
of Banbury dated before your involvement.

372
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,035
But that would be frightfully embarrassing!
Taking credit for something I didn't do.

373
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,190
Yes, I can see the headlines now.
''PM takes credit for Dean's mercy mission''.

374
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,198
''Jim didn't fix it!'' Sorry.

375
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,074
- He must be stopped! How can we stop him?
- He feels he hasn't had enough recognition...

376
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,439
That the Church hasn't had enough recognition
for its role in Kumran.

377
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,997
Well, give him some.
Get him round for drinks. Photo opportunity.

378
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,714
- That might be a little improper.
- Why?

379
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,836
If you're considering two candidates,
you can hardly invite just one round for a drink.

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,237
- I see.
- Unless, of course...

381
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,594
If you'd already given him the job,
then it would be perfectly proper.

382
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,597
Oh.

383
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,389
Actually, Humphrey,

384
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,757
I think he's rather a good choice for bishop.

385
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,037
- He's an enterprising chap.
- Enterprising.

386
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,392
- Eccentricity can be a virtue.
- If you call it individualism.

387
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,390
I have an independent mind,
you are an eccentric, he is round the twist.

388
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,073
Sorry.

389
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,394
Thank you, Bernard. Furthermore, we need
people like him in the House of Lords.

390
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,588
- People who really understand the Arab world.
- And steam engines.

391
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,590
Yes, on mature consideration,
I think the Dean of Baillie is my choice.

392
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,149
Convey that to the Palace, Bernard.

393
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,751
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Now! Fast. Announce it by midday.

394
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,912
Get him round for a drinkie at six. Move!

395
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,708
- A wise decision, if I may say so.
- You may, Humphrey.

396
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,040
How come you know so much about the Dean
of Baillie? Weren't you at Baillie yourself?

397
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,756
- I was, yes.
- Jobs for the boys, is it?

398
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,554
On the contrary! I hardly know him.

399
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,393
In fact, I happen to know that he dislikes me.

400
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,271
You can ask him yourself this evening.
I don't like him very much, either.

401
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,074
- Honestly?
- On my word of honour.

402
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,512
- You have nothing to gain?
- How could I have?

403
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,109
In that case, well done.

404
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,434
Helpful, impartial advice.
The best traditions of the Civil Service.

405
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,592
Yes, Prime Minister.
