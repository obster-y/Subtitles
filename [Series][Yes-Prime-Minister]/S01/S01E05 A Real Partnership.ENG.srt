1
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,801
Hello, darling. Good Cabinet meeting?

2
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,959
- Hmm.
- Good Cabinet meeting, darling?

3
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:48,881
- I want a triple Scotch!
- As bad as that? Why?

4
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:56,276
The financial crisis is much worse
than we thought. All the Cabinet must make cuts.

5
00:00:56,487 --> 00:01:00,924
- Bernard, would you like a Scotch?
- Yes, a large one, please.

6
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,278
Humphrey should have seen this coming.

7
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:08,685
I don't think he understands Economics.
He did read Classics.

8
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:11,236
Sir Frank is head of the Treasury.

9
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:16,396
He's at an even greater disadvantage
in understanding Economics. He's an economist.

10
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:21,601
- Can't they see there's got to be cuts?
- In other departments, not in their own!

11
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,201
So you ordered a clampdown?

12
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:29,395
- I can't do that. I'm only the Prime Minister.
- But you're in charge.

13
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:33,566
A leader can only lead by consent, consensus.
That's democracy.

14
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,759
- So who IS in charge?
- Nobody, really.

15
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:41,205
- Is that good?
- It must be. That's what democracy is about.

16
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:47,516
And I've got a deputation of MPs coming
to see me about a pay rise I promised them.

17
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:51,322
- What will you say?
- That I deeply sympathise. I don't.

18
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,876
That they fully deserve it. Not true.

19
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,837
And that I shall make it my first priority
as soon as the crisis is over. I shan't.

20
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:03,000
If they vote themselves
a whacking great pay rise,

21
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:07,399
it doesn't do very much
for the dignity of Parliament. It doesn't.

22
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:12,601
- Are they underpaid?
- Underpaid?! Backbench MPs? Darling...

23
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,799
Being an MP is a vast, subsidised ego trip.

24
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:21,883
You need no qualifications, no compulsory
hours of work, no performance standards.

25
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:27,915
A warm room and subsidised meals for a bunch
of self-opinionated windbags and busybodies

26
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:33,921
who suddenly find people taking them seriously
because they've got ''MP'' after their names!

27
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,877
How can they be underpaid when there's
about 200 applicants for every vacancy?

28
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:43,643
You could fill every seat 20 times over
even if they paid to do the job!

29
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,441
You were a backbench MP only 5 years ago.

30
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,996
I was the exception.

31
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,761
I was the cream. I rose to the top.

32
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,916
- Do you think you'll shut them up?
- Who knows?

33
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:03,599
The public will never stand for an MPs' pay rise
when we cut back on nurses and teachers.

34
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,560
Oh, that's a much more serious problem.

35
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:11,557
No, darling, much LESS serious. They can't
vote against me till the next election.

36
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:14,525
Backbenchers can do it at 10 o'clock tonight.

37
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,799
Humphrey, I've just had a very stormy meeting
with my backbenchers!

38
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,960
- I'm so sorry.
- If I had warning, I'd have softened them up.

39
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:28,518
- Papers only arrived the night before Cabinet!
- Most regrettable.

40
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:34,359
It's up to you, Humphrey. You must insist
that we get papers circulated earlier.

41
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:39,357
Alas, there are grave problems
in circulating papers before they are written.

42
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,757
Why the sudden crisis?

43
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:48,246
- Prime Minister, you must ask Sir Frank.
- What would Sir Frank say?

44
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:50,915
It is not for a humble mortal such as I

45
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:55,877
to speculate on the complex
and elevated deliberations of the mighty,

46
00:03:56,047 --> 00:04:00,837
but, in general, I think Sir Frank believes that
if the Treasury knows something must be done,

47
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,999
the Cabinet shouldn't have time to think about it..

48
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:05,606
Outrageous!

49
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:10,597
- Yes, indeed. It's known as Treasury policy.
- Suppose the Cabinet has questions?

50
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:15,562
His view is on the rare occasions
when the Treasury understands the questions,

51
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:18,719
the Cabinet doesn't understand the answers.

52
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,919
- Do you subscribe to that view?
- I, Prime Minister,

53
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,318
I merely try to carry out your wishes.

54
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:30,317
I wish that in future all Cabinet papers
be circulated at least 48 hours in advance.

55
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,479
- Would you tell Sir Frank?
- Yes, of course.

56
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,242
I shall seek an audience with him at once.
Thank you.

57
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:43,398
Who does Frank think he is?
At least Old Humpy knows his place.

58
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:49,846
It was very loyal of him to tell me the truth.
They usually all stick together, don't they?

59
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,644
He's rather anxious because of your threat
to make Sir Frank head of the home Civil Service.

60
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:59,840
Of course.
I wonder if I should do something about that.

61
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:04,683
Or if there isn't something to be gained
out of keeping them both in suspense.

62
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,721
You gain an anxious Cabinet Secretary.
Is that what you want?

63
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,604
Hmm...

64
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,396
He wasn't just unhappy about the cuts, Frank.

65
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,879
He was very unhappy about your papers arriving
at such short notice.

66
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,682
I hope you explained
it was because of America's policy change.

67
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:26,839
My dear Frank, I defended you gallantly,

68
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,837
leaving the Prime Minister in no doubt
as to the real cause.

69
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,641
Oh, good. Thanks.

70
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,436
- I'll need his goodwill.
- Why?

71
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:43,038
We shall obviously have to bring in
some form of pay restraint.

72
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:47,803
The problem is,
the MPs are being denied their pay rise

73
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:51,801
just as we bring forward
the proposed Civil Service pay rise.

74
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,396
- Ah. That's an awkward one.
- Yes.

75
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:59,004
- One isn't interested for oneself...
- Of course not.

76
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,598
But one does owe it to one's junior colleagues.
Ironic, isn't it, Frank?

77
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:08,761
Trying to help them involves raising our own
salaries, which we don't care about at all.

78
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,561
And then we get accused
of feathering our own nests!

79
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,406
That's just another cross we have to bear.

80
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:19,167
Yes. Envy, pure envy.

81
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:24,878
You'd better get that proposal in fast
before the pay restraint begins.

82
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,476
The night before next Thursday's Cabinet.

83
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:31,640
We can't let Ministers spend two days
talking about it.

84
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,401
They'll come up with stupid objections!

85
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,246
And try to delay it until the pay restraint.

86
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:41,440
Mm. Do you think it's all right
to bounce the Cabinet two weeks running?

87
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:45,600
- No alternative.
- I-I-I was thinking, Humphrey.

88
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:51,635
Perhaps it would be better
if the proposal came from both of us.

89
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:56,517
- Both of us?
- Well, we are joint heads of the Civil Service.

90
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:59,639
Not as I understand it, Frank.

91
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,886
- Oh, I think so, effectively.
- I think not, effectively.

92
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:08,160
I look after the financial side
and you the establishment side.

93
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:13,885
But, Frank, with respect, the Cabinet Secretary
is the de jure head of the Civil Service.

94
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:18,877
With respect, Humphrey, the Cabinet Secretary
and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury

95
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,607
are de facto joint heads of the Civil Service.

96
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:26,403
Be that as it may, Frank,
we can't put up the proposal together.

97
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,956
I must remain aloof and judicial.

98
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:34,520
You must make the running. After weighty
consideration, I will come down on your side.

99
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,286
All right. One other point...

100
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,923
We don't want Cabinet to adjudicate on this.

101
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,325
- They must refer it to an impartial committee.
- Who should chair it?

102
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:51,275
- What about Professor Welsh?
- That silly old buffer?!

103
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,796
- That silly old buffer.
- Why?

104
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:59,001
He's asked me to put him forward as the next
chairman of the University Grants Committee.

105
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:03,763
He's desperate for the job,
so he'll understand what's required of him.

106
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,765
What an excellent choice.

107
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:09,316
Humphrey, I'm astonished.

108
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:14,277
The Treasury has just cancelled half
our spending plans due to the financial crisis

109
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:19,885
and now they have the temerity to put forward
a plan for a Civil Service pay rise!

110
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:22,476
And you're bouncing it through Cabinet!

111
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:28,085
I wanted all papers circulated 48 hours in
advance. Do you think I'm a complete idiot?

112
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,479
It is not for me to speak for Sir Frank.

113
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:39,158
I'm asking you. Speak for yourself.
You're head of the Civil Service.

114
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:44,077
- Am I indeed? How gratifying!
- For the moment.

115
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,678
As Cabinet Secretary,
I am most eager to reduce public spending,

116
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:53,841
but as head of the Civil Service I'm responsible
for the real dangers that arise administratively

117
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:59,798
if a pay rise does not come through very soon.
It's so difficult for me. I'm wearing two hats.

118
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,475
Yes, isn't that rather awkward for you?

119
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,921
Not if one is in two minds.

120
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,402
Or has two faces.

121
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,076
Perhaps I should relieve you of one of them?

122
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:19,166
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm perfectly happy with both.
- Faces?

123
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,483
Hats!

124
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:27,080
You see, Prime Minister, the problem is that
low morale will lead to the danger of a strike.

125
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:31,240
Think of the effect of that
on the social services.

126
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,195
And we are already experiencing difficulties
in recruitment.

127
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:40,083
- 10 applicants for every vacancy?
- Yes, but the applicants are very low quality.

128
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:45,640
With very few First Class degrees.
Most of them...have Lower Seconds.

129
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,082
I got a Third.

130
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:54,838
That's all right for Prime Ministers.
Sir Humphrey means civil servants.

131
00:09:55,047 --> 00:10:00,041
The point is, I couldn't get this through.
There's already a backbench revolt looming.

132
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:05,042
MPs will never agree to a pay rise for civil
servants. And the Cabinet will be hostile.

133
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:10,196
May I suggest that we just ask the Cabinet
merely to agree to look at the application?

134
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:14,758
Then we'll put the matter
before an independent group of assessors.

135
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:19,961
- Who would lead these assessors?
- There's a very good man I could recommend.

136
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:23,836
Professor Welsh.
Very sound, very sensible, very careful.

137
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,436
I heard he was a silly old buffer.

138
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:30,640
I can't imagine
who could possibly say such a thing!

139
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,598
Since the most senior grades of the service
really bear the heat of the battle,

140
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,361
they should receive the greatest increase.

141
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,916
Seems very fair to me.

142
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:44,875
- So this would be the scale.
- Right.

143
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:49,046
- I haven't seen this, by the way.
- Of course not. Most improper.

144
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:54,844
Quite. Well, they're very significant increases
for Under Secretaries,

145
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,396
Deputy Secretaries and, um,

146
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,967
those of us who, um...

147
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,964
Exactly.

148
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:05,516
About 43%.

149
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:10,195
- Alas.
- But no more than we've earned.

150
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,801
I take it this paper is not for submission.

151
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:17,398
My dear Humphrey,
those are the submission papers.

152
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,196
Oh, yes.

153
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:27,639
- It only goes up to Appendix K.
- Sorry. Six more to follow.

154
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:31,237
Oh! No danger of their wading through all those.

155
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,638
Where's the one-page summary for the Cabinet?

156
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,236
The Janet and John bit?

157
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,836
Here it is.

158
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:44,797
It's more or less the same as last time.
Comparable jobs in industry.

159
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:50,087
- On whose salary are the comparisons based?
- The directors of BP and IBM, naturally.

160
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:55,520
You don't think that might be challenged
as untypical and above average?

161
00:11:55,727 --> 00:12:00,721
No. Of course, we don't mention them
by name. Just ''typical industrial firms''.

162
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,642
Then we take our own examples of increases
from the lowest point of the incremental scale.

163
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:11,046
- As before.
- Principal examples are there at the end.

164
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:15,803
?.50 a week for a messenger.
?.20 for a registry clerk.

165
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,959
?.20 for a scientific officer. Hardly anything.

166
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:22,517
So it would be ?6,000 a year extra for us?

167
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,445
More or less.

168
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:32,316
- You haven't mentioned that, I hope.
- My dear Humphrey...

169
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,401
Frank, you don't think there's a danger
that someone might go into this in detail?

170
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:43,561
- Not that there's anything wrong with it.
- But who? Ministers are only briefed by us.

171
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,287
We're all loyal members of the service.

172
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:51,083
Yes. I'll get it in last item before lunch
on the Cabinet's agenda.

173
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:55,160
- They won't spend more than 5 minutes on it.
- Plain sailing.

174
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:59,360
Apart from the rigorous scrutiny
of Professor Welsh.

175
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:04,720
Your Chief Political Advisor is on the phone.

176
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:07,805
Thank you. Put her through. ..Dorothy?

177
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:14,276
I'm doing a paper on this Civil Service pay claim,
but I can give an immediate response.

178
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:18,241
- Yes, please. What's your answer?
- It's a series of questions.

179
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:21,041
- For me?
- For Sir Humphrey.

180
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:26,042
The claim is self-serving and inappropriate,
and significant for what it leaves unanswered.

181
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:31,037
- Right. Fire away.
- You should treat this as highly confidential.

182
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,846
First of all, you should ask what deduction...

183
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,196
Yes...

184
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,438
Triffic!

185
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:53,406
Oh, George, that's for you, I think.
All right for me to go in, Bernard?

186
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:57,958
Uh, yes. Sir Humphrey,
can I just mention one thing?

187
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,516
Yes, Bernard?

188
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:05,158
- There has been movement.
- On what subject?

189
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,962
On a subject we hoped for no movement.

190
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:13,877
The Civil Service generally hopes
there will be no movement on any subject!

191
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:19,081
Uh, yes, what I mean is it's in relation to
a subject that is normally wholly and exclusively

192
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:23,399
within the control of the Civil Service
that developments have developed.

193
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:26,405
- You're speaking in riddles!
- Oh, thank you.

194
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:30,919
That was NOT a compliment, Bernard!
Make yourself clear, please.

195
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,516
I'm sorry, Sir Humphrey, my lips are sealed.

196
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:38,477
I am referring to minutes that I was duty bound
to make of a confidential conversation

197
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,956
between the Prime Minister and an advisor.

198
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:44,204
- Which advisor?
- I cannot divulge her name.

199
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:50,403
Thank you, Bernard. And this confidential
advice was to do with the financial crisis?

200
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:54,316
- No, much more important.
- Not his silly nuclear strategy?

201
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:59,442
- Much more important.
- You don't mean the Civil Service pay claim?!

202
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,076
I see. What do you advise, Bernard?

203
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:08,281
I advise you consider your position carefully,
perhaps adopting a more flexible posture,

204
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:13,237
while keeping your ear to the ground,
covering your retreat and watching your rear.

205
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,160
Thank you, Bernard. You've been a great help.

206
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,597
Actually, I haven't told you anything.

207
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:23,801
- I should hope not. That's most improper.
- Prime Minister, Sir Humphrey's here.

208
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,923
Flexible.

209
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:32,002
- Ah, Humphrey! Come in.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

210
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,556
Tell me what you think of this.

211
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,522
What do you make of it?

212
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:45,517
- It is rather large for instant judgement.
- Only read the one-page summary.

213
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,197
- Ah. Oh, good.
- Well?

214
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,886
Well?

215
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:55,478
Prime Minister, you place me
in a very difficult position.

216
00:15:55,687 --> 00:16:01,603
Do I, Humphrey? You have to have loyalty
to your colleagues, but also to Cabinet policies.

217
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,879
- I agree.
- You agree?

218
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,805
- Yes.
- With me?

219
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:11,637
- I agree with you.
- I...ah... I don't... Who do you agree with?

220
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,839
- With you.
- Not with Sir Frank?

221
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,521
- No.
- You're not arguing with me?

222
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,524
No.

223
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,916
Perhaps I haven't made myself quite clear.

224
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:25,521
I agree with you!

225
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,316
Well, what do you make of that pay claim?

226
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,916
Well, it's not excessive in itself,

227
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:37,081
but at a time of national stringency
it is neither wise nor in the national interest.

228
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,841
I don't like to criticise my colleague, but...

229
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:44,797
In my view, Sir Frank,
though no doubt acting from the best of motives,

230
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:49,961
should have placed the good of the nation
before the narrower interests of civil servants.

231
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,846
You see, this claim raises serious questions.

232
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:57,757
That's interesting.
I've made a note of some questions, too.

233
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:02,163
Good questions. Where did they come from?

234
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,756
- Oh, occurred to me.
- Yes.

235
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,481
They're...VERY good questions.

236
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,923
Yes, that's what I thought. What should we do?

237
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:13,721
- We should ask them.
- Ask who?

238
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:17,522
Sir Frank.
You ought to invite him here to discuss them.

239
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:22,078
He may well know the answers.
Indeed, he should know them.

240
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,522
That's his job, after all.

241
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,560
Yes. Thank you. Arrange that, Bernard.

242
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,116
I must say I appreciate your impartiality.

243
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:34,075
You'd gain quite a lot yourself
if it were to go through.

244
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,676
Well, I suppose so, Prime Minister,

245
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,443
but I see the rewards of this job
as the knowledge...

246
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:47,284
..that we've been of service to the nation, not
to ourselves. Don't you agree, Prime Minister?

247
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,758
- I agree. Thank you, Humphrey.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

248
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,440
- Humphrey's very fair-minded, isn't he?
- Oh, yes, Prime Minister.

249
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:05,565
If there were a conflict of interests,
which side are the Civil Service really on?

250
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:08,235
The winning side, Prime Minister.

251
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:21,203
Ah, thank you, Billy. It was very painful for me
not to be able to support Frank's case.

252
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,359
- Deeply distressing.
- But he was going to lose.

253
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:30,124
And that Wainwright female had suggested
that they stop us handling our own pay claims

254
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,926
and let a Select Committee decide on them!

255
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:37,518
Appalling! Next thing you'd have
is politicians removing civil servants

256
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,805
on the grounds of incompetence!
The thin end of the wedge.

257
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:46,398
Arnold, I need your help.
Clearly, Frank's claim is discredited,

258
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:50,958
but I need to get us the pay rise
to consolidate my position.

259
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,243
What did you do?

260
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:57,645
- You say Frank used the normal formula?
- That's right.

261
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:01,402
- And you need 43%. Hm.
- Thereabouts.

262
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:05,560
Well, since virtually all the relevant staff
work in London,

263
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:10,517
start with a big increase in the London allowance.
Allowances count as expenses.

264
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:15,442
- They don't show in the percentage calculation.
- London allowance.

265
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:20,243
Then introduce a special graduate allowance
for those with Firsts and Upper Seconds.

266
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:24,639
- To aid recruitment.
- Oxford doesn't give Upper Seconds.

267
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:29,238
A second at Oxford counts as an Upper Second,
at least.

268
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:34,401
Then you double the Outstanding Merit awards.
I take it people still get them?

269
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,643
Oh, yes. Everyone.

270
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:40,123
They don't count as rises either. Getting there?

271
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:44,843
- That gets us down to only about 18%.
- Since last time?

272
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:49,643
Then don't calculate from last time.
Calculate from 1973, the high point.

273
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:55,598
And don't just take it to this year. Take it up
to two years' time, the end of the claim period.

274
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,884
Correcting for inflation, that should do it.

275
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:04,480
Excellent. The percentage increases will sound
all right now, but that still leaves a problem.

276
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:08,686
The overall Civil Service pay bill
will still be too high.

277
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:13,278
- Easy. Reduce the size of the Civil Service.
- What?!

278
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:21,276
If the service were smaller than last time,
a comfortable rise for individuals looks smaller.

279
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,445
Real reductions in the size of the service?!

280
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:28,282
It would be the end of civilisation as we know it!

281
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:32,878
No, my dear Humphrey.
All you do is stop calling them civil servants.

282
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,436
Take the museums, for instance.

283
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:41,204
If you turn them into independent trusts,
the staff stop being classified as civil servants.

284
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:46,157
They're still the same people doing the same job
and still paid by government grants,

285
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:51,321
but as it's a grant it doesn't count in the pay
statistics. Unless anyone inquires closely,

286
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:54,285
it will look like a cutback.

287
00:20:54,447 --> 00:21:00,522
- Can we set up so many trusts in time?
- You won't have to. It only has to be planned.

288
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:03,281
If it doesn't happen, it won't be your fault.

289
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:08,282
Meanwhile, you should be able
to get the rise to work out at 6% overall.

290
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:13,277
- Thank you, Arnold. That's a great help.
- Always happy to oblige.

291
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:16,439
Especially with the birthday honours coming up.

292
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,516
Should I talk to Frank about this, too?

293
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:27,199
Em...oh, no, Arnold. Leave it to me.
Frank's got a lot of problems coming up.

294
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:32,356
- Really? He hasn't mentioned them.
- Because he doesn't know about them yet.

295
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:38,200
And Civil Service pay has fallen significantly
behind comparable jobs in industry.

296
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:40,602
What comparable jobs?

297
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:45,397
Well, it's quite a complex formula,
but it has been accepted for some time.

298
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:50,397
I understand that a Permanent Secretary
earns over ?5,000 a year.

299
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:55,595
Cabinet Secretary and Permanent Secretary
to the Treasury earn in excess of ?1,000.

300
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,082
Um...maybe you're right.

301
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:02,997
Don't you know how much you earn, Frank,
or has it just slipped your memory?

302
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,880
Yes, but if that's what industry is paying...

303
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:10,080
- What do you think, Humphrey?
- It's not for me to say.

304
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,239
Sir Frank is in charge of Civil Service pay.

305
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:17,042
- Prime Minister, may I ask a question?
- Yes.

306
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:20,119
What deduction do you make for job security?

307
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:24,923
- I beg your pardon?
- Top people in industry can get sacked.

308
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,885
They can go bust, but your jobs are guaranteed.

309
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:32,080
- There are swings and roundabouts.
- What roundabouts?

310
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:35,239
- Long hours.
- Don't those happen in industry?

311
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:38,285
Industrial leaders must stand by decisions.

312
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:42,799
- So do civil servants.
- Really? I thought ministers took decisions.

313
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:48,001
- And the blame. That's the deal, isn't it?
- Yes, ministers do take the decisions.

314
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,318
Civil servants must decide how to carry it out.

315
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:55,122
- Like a secretary laying out a letter.
- Yes.

316
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:59,085
No! Um... Sir Humphrey knows what I mean.

317
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:03,644
It's up to you, Frank.
You're in charge of Civil Service pay.

318
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:08,124
What about the service element?

319
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,795
Service element? What do you mean?

320
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,804
Er...

321
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:20,286
- The job has a strong element of service.
- Absolutely.

322
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:24,878
Rewarded by CBs and KCMGs
and knighthoods...Sir Frank.

323
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:27,123
To an extent.

324
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:32,117
I wonder whether we shouldn't compare
civil servants with directors of charities

325
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:37,281
rather than industries. They get ?7,000 a year
on average, rather than ?5,000.

326
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:42,237
- That's an interesting proposal.
- Oh, no, I don't think... We'd never recruit.

327
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:46,320
Morale would plummet.
I'm sure Sir Humphrey would agree.

328
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:49,917
- Humphrey?
- Well, it's my opinion that...

329
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,681
..Sir Frank is in charge of Civil Service pay.

330
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:57,841
I do think the Prime Minister is entitled
to an answer, Frank.

331
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:04,122
- Then there are indexed pensions.
- Oh, well, those were agreed a long time ago.

332
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:08,320
- They're of considerable value.
- Of value, yes, but modest.

333
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:14,437
I have an estimate that it would cost ?50,000
to buy back a Permanent Secretary's pension.

334
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:16,922
- Absurd.
- How do you value it?

335
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:21,723
- Er, about ?00,000.
- In that case, I'll make you a deal, Frank.

336
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:26,677
The government will buy back your pension
and anyone else's who is willing to sell

337
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:32,444
at your own valuation. We'll pay you
?00,000 in cash for your pension rights. OK?

338
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:38,438
I was talking out of my...off the top
of my head. It could be...that is...

339
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,882
I haven't calculated it myself.

340
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:45,717
The figure of ?50,000 comes from the Society
of Insurance and Pension Actuaries.

341
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:50,762
Yes, but when it was agreed
I'm sure it was nothing like that.

342
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:55,757
What about this for an idea? An indexed
pension could be an alternative to honours.

343
00:24:55,927 --> 00:25:00,557
Every civil servant could choose
to take his reward as honours or cash.

344
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:03,076
- That's preposterous!
- Why?

345
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:07,246
- Yes, why?
- Well, it, it, it, it, it...

346
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:12,527
It would put us - put THEM - in an impossible
position. Some already have honours.

347
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:17,517
They could choose whether to renounce
their honour or their pension indexing.

348
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:22,681
What do you think, Sir Humphrey?
Or will you be Mr Appleby?

349
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:28,278
I'm sure that Sir Frank has gone into this
very thoroughly.

350
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:33,163
Not thoroughly enough.
You'd stand to gain quite a lot personally.

351
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,120
Prime Minister, that is not a consideration.

352
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:40,206
You'd be happy to be personally excluded
from this rise?

353
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,399
I know the Cabinet Secretary would be.

354
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:48,766
Well, of course, the question is...
in essence...not as a precedent...

355
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:51,521
..thinking of the service as a whole...

356
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:56,886
..fr-fr-fr-from the long-term point of view...
as a matter of principle...

357
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:03,005
- Go on.
- Well, of course...

358
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,964
..IF...

359
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:08,119
..if...the government did believe

360
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:12,280
that senior people should be paid less
than their subordinates,

361
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:17,043
and if the principle were extended
to Cabinet ministers and junior ministers.

362
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:20,762
Anyway, Frank,
thank you very much for coming in.

363
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,765
Thank you, Prime Minister.

364
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:33,200
- What do you make of that? A bit hard?
- No. Most proper and penetrating questions.

365
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:36,359
- What happens now?
- I'd like a word in private.

366
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:39,724
- I was just going.
- Good.

367
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,521
- Thank you very much indeed.
- Dear lady.

368
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,884
Not as dear as a Cabinet Secretary, Humphrey.

369
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:52,401
This is so difficult for me. One does so hate
to be disloyal to one's colleagues.

370
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,599
Clearly you've never been a Cabinet minister!

371
00:26:55,767 --> 00:27:00,557
I'd felt all along, at a time of stringency,
that the Treasury claim was too high.

372
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,116
Not in the nation's interests. Very nice for us,

373
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:08,281
but not something the Cabinet Secretary
with his higher loyalty could recommend.

374
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:13,840
It's why we don't let the Permanent Secretary
to the Treasury be head of the Civil Service.

375
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:18,603
So I've taken the liberty of drawing up
a much more modest submission

376
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:23,557
which is only 11% over two years
with the top grades rising by only the average

377
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:29,404
and the overall Civil Service pay bill
going up by only 6% a year over the period.

378
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,757
This looks much more reasonable.

379
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:36,563
Yes. The lower grades will have to go through
the normal procedures,

380
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:41,039
but I suggest that the First Division claim
should be processed with secrecy.

381
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:44,637
- Secrecy? Why?
- If there were widespread discussion,

382
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:49,637
it might backfire. Some of our people
might want to put in a much bigger claim.

383
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,401
Much better to present a fait accompli.

384
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:57,402
And may I advise against letting...advisors see it?

385
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:01,479
Are you sure your colleagues would accept 6%?

386
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,679
If I had your support and co-operation, yes.

387
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:10,280
It's still got to get through Parliament.
Backbenchers hate Civil Service pay rises.

388
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,876
Oh! How interesting you should say that!

389
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:17,438
I was just about to make a suggestion,
a major reform.

390
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:22,601
Well, if MPs' salaries were to be linked
to a grade in the Civil Service,

391
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,760
they wouldn't need to vote themselves pay rises
all the time.

392
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:29,919
If the Civil Service got one, they'd get one.

393
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,885
And if MPs' pensions were index-linked,

394
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,960
it would make them much less hostile
to Civil Service pay claims.

395
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,965
It certainly would. Excellent.

396
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:43,119
- Thank you, Humphrey.
- Prime Minister.

397
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:45,642
What grade ought backbenchers be?

398
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:49,840
- Senior Principals.
- Isn't that rather low?

399
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:52,316
Backbenchers are rather low.

400
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:56,918
- And what grade for Cabinet ministers?
- Under Secretaries.

401
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,317
And the Prime Minister?

402
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:03,520
Well, at the moment,
you earn even less than I do.

403
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:08,477
Why don't you grade yourself
as a Permanent Secretary?

404
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:12,959
- Thank you, Humphrey.
- After all, this is a partnership.

405
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:17,957
- Yes. A real partnership.
- Yes, Prime Minister.
