1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,589
Hello, darling!

2
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,354
Ah, the news! Got to me yet?

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,911
- No. What have you done now?
- A sensational Question Time.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,676
- I really made mincemeat of them.
- They haven't mentioned it yet.

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,229
- Typical BBC.
- It's not BBC.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,994
- Typical ITV.
- It's Channel 4.

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,597
Well, what can you expect? Turn it up, then.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,356
<i>There's growing anxiety for the fate of Benji,</i>
<i>an 0ld English sheepdog,</i>

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,390
<i>who last night got under the wire</i>
<i>and into the artillery range on Salisbury Plain.</i>

10
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,075
<i>Benji belongs to 8-year-old Linda Fletcher.</i>

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,956
<i>Linda lost both her parents in a car crash.</i>
<i>Both she and Benji survived.</i>

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,950
<i>Unfortunately, the area is full of unexploded</i>
<i>shells and is highly dangerous</i>

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,910
<i>except for one fixed road. Benji is a long way</i>
<i>from the road and seems to be lost.</i>

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>The Army expressed their regrets,</i>
<i>but say that unless he comes to the road</i>

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,236
<i>there's nothing they can do. If nothing happens</i>
<i>soon, he will either starve or be blown up.</i>

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,030
<i>Linda is preparing to spend</i>
<i>another night's vigil on Salisbury Plain,</i>

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,030
<i>hoping that Benji will come back.</i>
<i>And that's the news this evening.</i>

18
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,032
- Are you sure you watched all of the news?
- Yes.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,192
- Was it on, the bit about me?
- No.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,117
- You said you watched it all.
- But one mentally tunes out the boring bits.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,509
Not you, dear. You're not boring. Not to me,
even if you are to the rest of the country.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,714
The future defence of Britain was being
fought out in the great forum of the nation

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,112
and what do they give the viewers?
A rerun of ''Lassie Come Home''!

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,312
I think the Army ought to rescue that dog.

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,719
Kids lose dogs every day.
Should the Army rescue every one of them?

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,953
- You don't understand ordinary people.
- I am an ordinary person.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,755
- Oh, surely not (!)
- You want me to waste taxpayers' money

28
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,275
on buying cheap popularity?

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,956
Sometimes you have to do things
that aren't economic in a civilised society.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,553
Write a paper on that and submit it
to the Treasury. We don't get many laughs!

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,990
- The Director General of MI5, Prime Minister.
- Ah, hello, Geoffrey. Come along in.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,549
Thank you, Prime Minister.

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,837
Eh, I wonder if...

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,430
Oh, that's all right.
I always have Bernard present.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,954
- Not this time, Prime Minister.
- Ah. I don't always have Bernard present.

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,793
Do sit down.
I don't have any papers for this meeting.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,952
- No, it's too serious.
- Why?

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,950
- We've just received some information.
- Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,399
- Do you know John Halsted?
- Your predecessor. Died last month.

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,390
He left his personal papers to us.
We've started to go through them.

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,395
He was passing government secrets to Moscow
in the '50s and '60s.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,994
- The head of MI5?! A Russian agent?
- So it seems.

43
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,950
- Why did he leave his papers to you?
- His will said it was a final act of conscience.

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,069
I think it's just posthumous gloating.
Showing us he could get away with it.

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,273
- How much did he tell them?
- That hardly matters.

46
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,638
With Burgess, McLean, Philby, Blake
and Fuchs and the Krogers,

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,598
one more didn't make much more difference.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,075
- The point is he was one of us.
- One of us?

49
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,478
Joined MI5 straight from Cambridge,
Civil Service all his life.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,794
If this ever gets out, all of us recruited
in his time will be suspects for ever.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,072
Yes. ..You're not a spy, are you?

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,154
Only joking. You're not, are you? No...

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,074
This is not all. We held an internal security
investigation into Sir John in the '70s.

54
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,232
- There was a lot of speculation. Remember?
- Vaguely.

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,868
All totally irresponsible and ill-informed.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,077
- When the press suggested he was a spy?
- Yes.

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,272
- Well, he was.
- But they didn't know that!

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,956
They were being totally ignorant.
They just happened to be accurate.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,349
Anyway, the inquiry cleared him completely,

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,513
but they missed some rather obvious
questions and checks.

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,148
So obvious that...well... One wonders.

62
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,157
Yes.

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,189
What does one wonder?

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,836
One wonders about the chaps who cleared him.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,549
I see. Whether they were stupid, you mean?

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,070
No, Prime Minister. Whether they were also...

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,272
Spies?! My God!

68
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,230
- Who headed that inquiry?
- Old Lord MacIver, but he was ill a lot.

69
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,236
Well, ga-ga, actually. So, effectively,
it was the secretary who conducted it.

70
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,070
- Who was the secretary?
- Humphrey Appleby.

71
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,078
- Humphrey?!
- Yes, Prime Minister.

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,274
- You think he may have been a spy, too?
- It's a remote possibility, but very unlikely.

73
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,908
- He's one of us.
- So was John Halsted.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,675
Well, yes, but there's no other evidence
against Humphrey.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,158
Might he have been covering up for one of us...
one of you?

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,956
I suppose so, but I have no doubts at all
about his loyalty.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,989
- It's much more likely to be just...
- Hideous incompetence.

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,910
We haven't been through the rest of his papers.
You could hold an inquiry into Sir Humphrey.

79
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,716
- Could I?
- Well, I wouldn't recommend it at this stage.

80
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,997
We don't want more irresponsible speculation.

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,795
- Even if it's accurate.
- Especially if it's accurate.

82
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,318
There's nothing worse than accurate,
irresponsible, ill-informed press speculation.

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,117
You could send Humphrey off on gardening leave
while we examine the Halsted papers.

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,517
- Gardening leave?
- And you could confront him.

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,913
- The substantive evidence is all here.
- Shouldn't we just forget about it?

86
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,509
Well, obviously, it's your decision,

87
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,674
but if you did nothing and it emerged later
that Sir Humphrey...that he was...

88
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,672
..one of them, well, it might not look too good.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,029
Not to mention that as Cabinet Secretary
he co-ordinates our security services.

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,431
- There are no secrets from him.
- You're right.

91
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,430
But I find it hard enough to believe
that one of us was one of them.

92
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,989
But if two of us were one of them...

93
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,995
Two of them.

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,549
..all of us could be, um...

95
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,149
All of them.

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,118
Thank you, Geoffrey. I've heard enough.

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,715
Awful! Another three points down in the polls.

98
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,119
- Not the government. Only your personal rating.
- What have I done wrong?

99
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,832
- Low popularity usually means doing it right.
- It's not my failure to get defence cuts?

100
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,388
To be honest, I don't think defence cuts are the
principal topic of conversation in supermarkets.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,195
- What is?
- To judge from the popular press,

102
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,158
it's the lost dog on Salisbury Plain.

103
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,830
Perhaps the government needs a lost dog policy.

104
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,636
- Anything else, Prime Minister?
- Yes, there is something else.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,590
- A security matter. Bernard, would you mind?
- I'm sorry?

106
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,793
- What are you doing?
- Well, I thought...

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,114
- There wasn't anyone...
- I was just hoping you'd leave us alone.

108
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,997
Oh!

109
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,072
Oh. Yes.

110
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,995
- Prime Minister.
- Yes, Humphrey.

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,396
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Something...very secret.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,594
Would it be easier if I wasn't here?

113
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,192
A few years ago, there was a security inquiry.

114
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,557
Does the name Sir John Halsted ring a bell?

115
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,231
Yes, of course. In fact,
I had to conduct the inquiry myself, virtually.

116
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,831
- And you found nothing incriminating?
- Of course not.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,993
John Halsted was one of us.
We'd been friends for years.

118
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,549
The whole story was got up by the press

119
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,236
and the whole object of internal security
inquiries is to find no evidence.

120
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,954
Even if the security of the realm is at risk?

121
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,358
If you really believe that,
you call in the Special Branch.

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,116
Government security inquiries are only used
for killing press stories.

123
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,876
They enable the Prime Minister
to stand up in the House and say,

124
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,508
''There is no evidence for these charges.''

125
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,317
- What if you found something suspicious?
- Practically all of government is suspicious.

126
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,759
The fact that you asked Bernard to leave us
alone might be construed as suspicious.

127
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,350
- Indeed.
- But the whole story was clearly a nonsense.

128
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,239
Typical Fleet Street sensationalism.

129
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,276
- So he wasn't passing secrets to Moscow?
- Impossible. Out of the question.

130
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,273
- You'd stake your reputation on it?
- Without hesitation.

131
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,077
I see. Well, I'm afraid I have to tell you
that for a substantial part of his career

132
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,232
he was a Russian spy.

133
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,678
I don't believe it. Who says so?

134
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,273
He does. He left his papers to the government,
including a detailed confession. MI5 agrees.

135
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,034
It checks out all along the line.

136
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,997
But...

137
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,118
Good Lord, he... I mean, he was...

138
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,075
- One of us?
- Exactly! This leaves a lot of questions.

139
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,432
Yes, and I'm asking you -
why didn't you ask him a lot of questions?

140
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,990
Why did the inquiry exonerate him so quickly?

141
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,910
I've already told you!
Anyway, we were very busy. Besides...

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,837
Good Lord! You don't think...?
I mean, surely nobody suspects...?

143
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,830
- What else was I expected to do?
- You could have held a proper inquiry.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,073
- He had a surprisingly long stay in Yugoslavia.
- Yes?

145
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,149
Shortly afterwards, several MI5 agents
were rounded up and never seen again.

146
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,955
- Yes...
- He spent a lot of time with one interpreter.

147
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,113
And she turned out to be a Russian agent.
We knew that.

148
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,874
Most Yugoslav interpreters are Russian agents.

149
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,679
Those who aren't with the CIA, that is.

150
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,156
- You never followed it up.
- I had better things to do.

151
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,956
Three months later, she moved to England
and settled in Cambridge,

152
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,240
150 yards from Sir John Halsted's house.
They were neighbours for the next 11 years.

153
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,431
Crikey!

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,990
You can't check up on everything!
You never know what you might find!

155
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,029
- If you have such a suspicious mind...
- Hold security inquiries.

156
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,231
Ye...no!

157
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,755
John gave me his word. Halsted.
The word of a gentleman.

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,997
Anyway, I have a problem. You.

159
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,994
Me? You don't think...?

160
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,549
You couldn't think...

161
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,154
I don't speak a word of Russian!

162
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,033
It was either incompetence or collusion.

163
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,913
I give you my word it wasn't collusion!

164
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,399
- The word of a gentleman?
- Exactly! An Oxford gentleman.

165
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,798
- How's the garden?
- Oh, well, it...

166
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,517
- I beseech you, not gardening leave.
- Why not?

167
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,350
- I have my reputation to think of!
- You staked that on Halsted's innocence.

168
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,918
- I think I'll talk to your predecessor.
- Arnold? Why?

169
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,588
I've no experience of this sort of thing.

170
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,276
I need Arnold's advice on setting up
a security inquiry on a Cabinet Secretary.

171
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,869
Anyway, thank you, Humphrey.

172
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,550
That will be all.

173
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,637
Yes...

174
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
For the time being.

175
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,600
Don't discuss this with Arnold.

176
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,998
Of course not, Prime Minister!
I wouldn't dream of it.

177
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,068
So what do you think I should do, Arnold?

178
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,871
Difficult. Depends a bit
on whether you actually were spying or not.

179
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,993
- Arnold!
- One must keep an open mind.

180
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,670
But I couldn't have been. I wasn't at Cambridge.

181
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,069
I'm not one of them. I'm a married man.

182
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,154
One of us.
I've been in the Civil Service all my life.

183
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,591
- So had John Halsted.
- But he was different.

184
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,270
- Why?
- Well, John used to believe in things. Causes.

185
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,238
I've never believed in anything in my life!

186
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,994
He had ideas. Original ideas.

187
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,516
You know I've never done anything like that.

188
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,430
- Even if you were, I agree it mustn't get out.
- Do you, Arnold?

189
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,428
Of course.
Giving information to Moscow is serious.

190
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,070
- Giving information to anyone is serious.
- The Cabinet.

191
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,549
A scandal like this could gravely weaken
the authority of the service. You mustn't confess.

192
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,274
But I haven't done anything to confess to!

193
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,678
Be that as it may,
there is still the other possibility.

194
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,719
Let us assume, for the sake of argument,
that you are innocent.

195
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,311
- Oh, thank you, Arnold.
- Just assuming, without prejudice.

196
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,870
Then the question of incompetence arises.

197
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,469
But I wasn't incompetent.

198
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,997
You made it clear we were expected
to find no evidence against him.

199
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,115
- I have no recollections of that.
- Oh! You know perfectly well.

200
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,756
- You have written evidence of this?
- Of course not.

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,748
So we return to the question
of your incompetence.

202
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,311
You and I may know that you did the job
you were required to do,

203
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,119
but it's hard to explain that to politicians.

204
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,792
- Do they have to know?
- Not if we can help it. The PM is the danger.

205
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,396
- He may want to tell people.
- He mustn't!

206
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,199
- Can you stop him?
- I don't know.

207
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,997
You have to stop him. Suppose he told
the Cabinet? And they decided to suspend you?

208
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,994
Remove you to the chairmanship
of the War Graves Commission?

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,597
- They couldn't!
- They could, but they mustn't.

210
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,753
- But not because of you. You are expendable.
- I'm not!

211
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,512
Once they accept the principle that senior civil
servants can be removed for incompetence,

212
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,119
that would be thin end of the wedge. We could
lose dozens of our chaps. Hundreds, perhaps!

213
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,756
Thousands. Arnold, what am I going to do?

214
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,556
I suggest you make yourself so valuable
to the Prime Minister over the next few days

215
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,950
that he cannot afford to let you go.

216
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,950
- How?
- What is he really dead set on at the moment?

217
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,513
- Popularity.
- That is what all politicians are dead set on.

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,075
But he's dropping at the moment in the polls.

219
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,669
Then you must lift him up again.

220
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,719
Give him a popular role
in the biggest current news story.

221
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,630
Well, the biggest current news story
is a lost dog on Salisbury Plain.

222
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,434
- Well?
- Oh, Arnold.

223
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,549
Are you suggesting that I have the Prime
Minister crawling all over Salisbury Plain

224
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,236
with a mine detector in one hand
and a packet of Winalot in the other?

225
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,434
It would probably do Britain less harm
than anything else he'd be likely to be doing.

226
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,798
- The Permanent Secretary for Defence.
- Norman, good of you to come.

227
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,758
How did my Secretary of State do in Cabinet?

228
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,914
Well, so-so. I think Cabinet is starting
to resent his refusal to make defence cuts.

229
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,469
- But he didn't back down?
- No.

230
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,839
- Excellent. What can I do for you?
- Well, it's rather a sensitive one.

231
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,991
- Cruise missiles?
- No.

232
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,549
- Star Wars?
- No.

233
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,712
- What, then?
- Em...

234
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,077
It's this dog on Salisbury Plain.

235
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,671
Oh, that! The PM getting his knickers
in a twist? Don't worry. It's all under control.

236
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,628
- Oh, really?
- It will starve to death by the weekend.

237
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,191
They'll recover the body
and bury it just outside the gates.

238
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,150
Guards resting at arms reversed.
The C.O. comforting the weeping little girl.

239
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,313
Telly will lap it up, lovely pictures in the Sundays.

240
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,833
- How about rescuing it?
- Don't be silly, Humphrey. It's dangerous.

241
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,918
- But to do it safely.
- Safely?

242
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,076
A squadron of Royal Engineers with mine
detectors, the Veterinary Corps with stun darts,

243
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,633
a helicopter with winching equipment
and a bill up in the hundreds of thousands

244
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,588
for a dog you could replace for a fiver
at the local pet shop!

245
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,995
But it could be done?

246
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,277
- If you've got the money.
- Could you do it?

247
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,270
You must be mad! Here we are
under the greatest pressure to cut spending

248
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,434
and you suggest that we waste hundreds
of thousands in front of the press on a dog!

249
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,239
It would be departmental suicide.

250
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,231
Yes, but if the Prime Minister were
to authorise it, if it was his initiative,

251
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,428
wouldn't it make it harder for him
to insist on defence cuts after that?

252
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,234
Humphrey, you excel yourself.

253
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,872
Especially if he didn't find out the true size
of the cost until after the rescue.

254
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,469
What do you want me to do?

255
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,918
Put the rescue operation on standby
in strict confidence.

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,918
And promise me the PM will get all the credit.

257
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,712
No nonsense about your Secretary of State
trying to muscle in on all the publicity.

258
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,072
- You've been briefed by MI5?
- Indeed, Prime Minister. Unfortunate.

259
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,353
- Disastrous.
- Not disastrous. It will never come out.

260
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,678
- Things are only disastrous if people find out?
- Of course.

261
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,389
Even if the Cabinet Secretary is a spy?

262
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,990
- I'm happy to say that is not the case.
- Why so sure?

263
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,950
MI5 have just come across this
in the Halsted papers, from his private diary.

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,358
''Another session with that prize goof Appleby.

265
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,998
''Fooled him completely.
He never asked any difficult questions,

266
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,549
''didn't seem to have read the MI5 report.

267
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,510
''So much wool in his head
it's child's play to pull it over his eyes.''

268
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,069
- That certainly...
- Exonerates Sir Humphrey.

269
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,671
Arnold...I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.

270
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,594
- Shall I...?
- No, no. I'll keep this.

271
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,952
I take it there's nothing for me to investigate?

272
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,551
- Not on security grounds.
- Good. I'll take up no more of your time.

273
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,553
Hold on. There's still the incompetence.

274
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,957
Well, of course, we all make mistakes.

275
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,756
- Not on that scale. Think I should sack him?
- I hardly think so.

276
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,556
- No? Should civil servants never be sacked?
- If they deserve it, of course.

277
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,154
In principle, but not in practice.

278
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,751
- Why not?
- There would have to be an inquiry.

279
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,109
All inquiries into the incompetence of civil
servants lead back to mistakes by ministers.

280
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,110
- On second thoughts, leave it with me.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

281
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,198
- (KNOCKING)
- Sir Humphrey.

282
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,352
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Show him in, Bernard. Show him in!

283
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,879
- Prime Minister.
- Ah!

284
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,196
Goofy. Er, Humphrey.

285
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,398
I'm happy to tell you
you've been cleared of spying.

286
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,388
- How?
- Something Sir John Halsted wrote.

287
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,757
- Oh, that's very gratifying.
- Isn't it?

288
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,750
- May one see the document?
- One certainly may.

289
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,428
Better still, one can have it read to one.

290
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,833
''May 28th. Another session with that prize goof
Appleby. Fooled him completely...''

291
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,830
- Yes, thank you.
- No, it goes on. It clears you even more.

292
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,915
- ''He never asked any difficult questions...''
- Yes, that's quite clear.

293
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,114
''So much wool in his head, it's child's play
to pull it over his eyes.'' Isn't that wonderful?

294
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,874
You must be a very happy man.

295
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,513
Halsted was a hopeless judge of character.

296
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,316
- You mean we can't believe this?
- Oh, no, no, no.

297
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,869
No, no, it's absolutely true.

298
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,269
True, that is, in the sense of...

299
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,589
You see, he wasn't bright enough

300
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,788
to understand subtle questioning techniques.
The non-confrontational approach.

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,391
- Lulled him into a TRUE sense of security?
- No, no, no.

302
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,709
Anyway, I take it it's all over now?

303
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,756
The matter of collusion, yes. But would you
condone incompetence of this sort?

304
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,351
It was a long time ago.
I had many other onerous duties.

305
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,552
- You have many now.
- Yes. And, in fact...

306
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,158
..I have been giving some thought to how
you might increase your popularity rating.

307
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,238
- Yes?
- Strong government needs a popular PM.

308
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,238
- You should do something popular.
- But what?

309
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,433
I was about to suggest
that you might intervene personally

310
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,194
to save that poor little doggie on Salisbury Plain.

311
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,834
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

312
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,429
It certainly would be very popular.

313
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,478
- Would it be very expensive?
- Surely not.

314
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,069
Could we cost it?

315
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,028
Well, I gather that time
is running out for little Benji.

316
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,668
We have to make a decision this morning.

317
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,115
There are times when you have to act
from the heart, even as Prime Minister.

318
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,233
- You're right, Humphrey!
- May I?

319
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,831
Please do. It's not a question
of buying cheap popularity.

320
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,110
By no means.

321
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,632
- Will it take long?
- I've got the Army on three-hour standby.

322
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,231
- Splendid.
- Is that you, Norman? Walkies.

323
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,191
<i>And finally, Benji, the 0ld English sheepdog</i>
<i>lost on the artillery range on Salisbury Plain</i>

324
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,909
<i>has been rescued. Martin Muncaster reports.</i>

325
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,510
<i>The operation began here on B Range.</i>

326
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,277
<i>Four detachments of the Royal Engineers with</i>
<i>mine detectors set off from different points</i>

327
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,793
<i>to close in on where Benji was last sighted.</i>
<i>It took them over an hour to locate him.</i>

328
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,312
<i>Then the Royal Veterinary Corps</i>
<i>fired a stun dart at Benji.</i>

329
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,072
<i>Unfortunately, the area is too dangerous</i>
<i>to enter without detonating shells,</i>

330
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,272
<i>so a Royal Navy helicopter was flown in</i>

331
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,270
<i>and they lowered a man to pick up Benji</i>
<i>without crossing the dangerous ground</i>

332
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,434
<i>and fly him to safety. Later, he was reunited</i>
<i>with his young owner, Linda Fletcher,</i>

333
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,196
<i>who said she'd almost given up hope</i>
<i>of ever seeing Benji again.</i>

334
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,992
<i>It's understood that direct intervention</i>
<i>from the Prime Minister made this possible.</i>

335
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,316
- Darling, you got them to rescue that dog!
- Yes.

336
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,270
- You said it would be a waste of money.
- I know, but government is caring.

337
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,513
- Caring about votes?
- That's not very kind, Annie.

338
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,714
I thought about that little girl and what Benji
must mean to her. Individuals do count,

339
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,678
even in a world of budgets and balance sheets.

340
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,832
Some people might criticise me,

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,437
but sometimes doing the right thing
means risking unpopularity.

342
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,236
Well, I won't criticise you, darling.
I think you're wonderful.

343
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,995
See this, Humphrey?

344
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,756
''Britain learned today that a real human heart
beats inside Number 10 Downing Street.''

345
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,233
- Actually, 74 human hearts beat inside here.
- Thank you, Bernard.

346
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,512
See? I was right. I have an instinct
for what people want.

347
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,113
- If I may say so, Prime Minister...
- Of course! It was your idea, wasn't it?

348
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,670
Well done. What can I do for you?

349
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,795
- The Halsted inquiry?
- Say no more about it. Completely forgotten.

350
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,994
Oh, thank you. Now may we discuss
the Cabinet agenda? One or two points.

351
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,073
- Item 3...
- Linda says, ''My vote goes to Mr Hacker!''

352
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,995
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm sorry, Humphrey. Yes?

353
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,594
''BBC and ITV report a flood of phone calls,

354
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,469
''all approving the PM's decision to rescue Benji.''

355
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,877
May I suggest that we postpone Item 3?

356
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,830
''The Leader of the Opposition was not available
for comment.'' I bet he wasn't!

357
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,994
Support me or let pet dogs starve to death!
I really had him there, didn't I?

358
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,391
- Sorry, Humphrey.
- Item 3.

359
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,195
Yes, what's Item 3?
Defence cuts? What about them?

360
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,676
We should refer them to Cabinet Committee.

361
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,476
No, I want a decision on Thursday,
not a 60-page submission next Easter.

362
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,276
Ah, because I've just had the provisional costings

363
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,079
for the dog rescue operation.

364
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,198
?10,000?!

365
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,911
- That's impossible!
- Those are MoD figures on a true-cost basis.

366
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,716
- This is absurd. We must do something.
- Put the dog back?

367
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,113
- That's ridiculous. I'm not postponing Item 3.
- Well, it's your decision, Prime Minister.

368
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,511
And a very courageous one, if I may say so.

369
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,194
Courageous? Why?

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,758
Well, if the defence cuts are made, the cost
of rescuing a dog is bound to be leaked.

371
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,670
- Oh, no.
- Unless you have faith in MoD confidentiality.

372
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,350
Don't be absurd! They leak like sieves.

373
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,759
I can see it now. ''Prime Minister saves dog
at expense of Britain's air defences.''

374
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,436
- It would be quite a story.
- A shaggy dog story.

375
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,871
But it would only come out if...

376
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,471
- I'm not going to be blackmailed.
- Of course not.

377
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,912
On the other hand, one can cut defence too far.

378
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,552
- Absolutely.
- Defence of the realm. First duty of government.

379
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,912
- First duty.
- There are emergencies - Korea, the Falklands.

380
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,112
- Benji.
- Benji! Yes.

381
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,997
I think I may have been a little hasty.
Item 3 probably needs a bit more thought.

382
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,354
- I'm sure that's wise.
- No hurry. Refer defence cuts to committee.

383
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,358
Yes, Prime Minister.
