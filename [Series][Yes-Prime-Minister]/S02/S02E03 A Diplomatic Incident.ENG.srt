1
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,332
Humphrey, we've got to discuss this ceremony
for the start of work on the Channel Tunnel.

2
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:52,493
- The Foreign Office is stalling.
- They say things still haven't been finalised.

3
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,253
About time they were. Big occasion.

4
00:00:55,419 --> 00:01:02,018
The inauguration, the laying of the foundation
stone by the Prime Minister, James Hacker.

5
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:07,173
(LIKE CHURCHILL) This historic link between
our two great sovereign democracies.

6
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:10,968
- Great coverage.
- F.O. Haven't agreed everything with the French.

7
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:15,417
The only solution is for me to have a meeting
with the French president

8
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,615
and sort it out myself.

9
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,009
I had no idea that you were considering
such a stimulating approach.

10
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:30,207
- Well, I am.
- Are you capable of concluding this negotiation?

11
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:35,169
- What are the outstanding points?
- Mainly they're concerned with sovereignty.

12
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:40,049
Where do you believe the frontier should be?
The frontier between Britain and France.

13
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,017
What's wrong with wherever it is now?

14
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,013
The three-mile limit.
Who would own the middle of the tunnel?

15
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:52,058
The British position is that
we should own half each.

16
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,814
- That seems fair.
- The French don't think it's fair.

17
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,449
- They want the frontier to be at Dover.
- Ridiculous.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,214
- Who would have sovereignty over the trains?
- Um...

19
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,453
If a crime was committed on a French train
in the British sector, who'd have jurisdiction?

20
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,453
The British. Well... No, the French. No, the British.

21
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:16,851
And if a body was pushed out of a British train
in the French sector?

22
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,058
Well, the French. Um... no, the British. Um...

23
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,929
If a British lorry was loaded onto a French train
in the British sector?

24
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,535
A British lorry, the British... or the French.

25
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,809
Could jurisdiction be divided into two legs?
Home and away?

26
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,658
Yes, thank you, Bernard. Should we have
a frontier post in the middle of the tunnel?

27
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,573
- Well, yeah. Er, no.
- Halfway across?

28
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,336
Should we have customs and immigration
clearance at one end or the other or both ends?

29
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:55,538
With respect, these are points
for the lawyers to discuss.

30
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,056
Precisely, but I thought I heard you say
you wanted to handle it yourself.

31
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,610
I don't want to discuss points
of abstruse international law.

32
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:09,170
- I want to get the political points settled.
- So sovereignty's not political?

33
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,773
How interesting.

34
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,296
The French want the signs to be in French first
and English second.

35
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,337
- No!
- Then you can't have your ceremony.

36
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,890
Well, French first at the French end
and English first at the English end?

37
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:27,131
- What about on the trains?
- Oh, does it matter?

38
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,009
- And the menus? French or English?
- Couldn't they be changed halfway?

39
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,773
No. The French are adamant.

40
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:39,933
That is why the British and French Concorde
are spelt the French way with an E.

41
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,694
- Don't we ever get our way with the French?
- Sometimes.

42
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,057
- When was the last time?
- Battle of Waterloo, 1815.

43
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,371
- The French may raise the question of hijacking.
- Hijacking?

44
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,930
What if terrorists hijacked the train
and threatened to blow up the tunnel?

45
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,774
Give the French jurisdiction over the lot,
then it's their problem.

46
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,491
If you'd handled the negotiations, you'd have
just handed everything over to the French.

47
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,132
I personally believe the French will come up with
a totally underhand ploy to gain the advantage.

48
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,052
But no doubt you've anticipated that.

49
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:20,371
I don't think it's necessary
for me to conduct these negotiations.

50
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,249
If humiliating concessions have to be made,
let the Foreign Secretary make them.

51
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,616
- Very wise.
- Let's have a glass of sherry, Bernard.

52
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,977
May we discuss the vexed question
of your predecessor's memoirs?

53
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,528
- What now?
- The final chapter

54
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,487
concerns his resignation
and your accession to the premiership.

55
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,971
- He wants access to certain papers.
- Can't we stop these bloody memoirs?

56
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,894
- Memoirs, alas, are an occupational hazard.
- It's the betrayal that upsets me.

57
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,768
Until I'd read the first seven chapters,
I thought he was a friend.

58
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,737
- He says some shocking things.
- Such as?

59
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,687
- He calls me two-faced.
- That was very wrong.

60
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,091
- You admit he was wrong?
- Yes, indeed. Cheers.

61
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,376
- Unforgivably indiscreet.
- Have you seen it?

62
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,808
- Oh, and wrong.
- How can he tell such lies about me?

63
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,733
- What lies? Oh, yes, I see.
- What's in it for him?

64
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,459
- Bestseller?
- No, it's not that.

65
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:22,089
He lies because it's in his nature.

66
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,252
He's treacherous, malevolent... and vile.

67
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,129
If he thinks he'll get any more honours
or quangos, he's got another think coming!

68
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:34,496
- (PHONE)
- He's not getting one ounce more recognition!

69
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,053
Yes. Look, is this important? Because...

70
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,016
Oh.

71
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,898
No? Oh.

72
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:47,809
He was dead on arrival? I see. Thanks.

73
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,208
- Bad news, Bernard?
- Yes... and no.

74
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,088
Your predecessor,
the previous Prime Minster of Great Britain,

75
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,648
has just died of a heart attack.

76
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:12,014
- Tragic.
- Tragic.

77
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,934
- He was a great man.
- Great man.

78
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,613
- He'll be sorely missed.
- Sorely missed.

79
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,930
- So will his memoirs.
- Which will never be finished.

80
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,488
- Alas.
- Alas.

81
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,693
Apparently, just before the end, he expressed
a hope that he might have a state funeral.

82
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:36,058
- But in view of your wish to pay him no...
- No, you must have misunderstood me.

83
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:41,498
- Many people will want to attend his funeral.
- To pay tribute to a great Prime Minister?

84
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,377
Yeah...

85
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,928
...and to make sure he's dead.

86
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,735
Seven Commonwealth Prime Ministers,
the American Vice President,

87
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,094
six European Prime Ministers.

88
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,819
- Pretty good.
- Very good, Prime Minister.

89
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:01,176
- I am the host.
- Yes, indeed.

90
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,968
Amongst all the world's leaders,
centre of the world stage.

91
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,291
- Bearing your grief with dignity and fortitude.
- Quite.

92
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,929
Dignified grief goes down very well
with the voters,

93
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,091
especially when it's shared by world statesmen.

94
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,648
It's a wonderful thing, death.

95
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,495
So uncontroversial. What's this query
against the French Prime Minister?

96
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,412
The French ambassador's coming to see you.

97
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,047
Plenty of room for TV cameras.

98
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,894
Outside No.10, outside the abbey,
inside the abbey.

99
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,414
One pointing directly at my pew.

100
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,369
Um... wouldn't that mean
putting the cameraman in the pulpit?

101
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,649
Will that be all right?

102
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,248
It won't leave a lot of room for the Archbishop.

103
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,251
Well... So where will he preach from?

104
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,454
- He'll need to be in the pulpit.
- Where will my camera be?

105
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:09,692
There's always the high altar, but I think
the Archbishop may need that as well.

106
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,089
Who does he think he is?

107
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,570
He thinks it's a religious ceremony.
Nobody's told him it's a party political.

108
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:22,572
- The French ambassador here, is he?
- Yes, but could I have a word first?

109
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,936
The French PM isn't coming.
The President's coming instead.

110
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,091
- President? Marvellous!
- No, it's terrible!

111
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,650
When the Queen visited France,
she presented him with a Labrador puppy.

112
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:36,811
- Now he's bringing her one of its puppies.
- No!

113
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,095
- Afraid so.
- I knew it!

114
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,650
- It seems to be rather a nice gesture.
- It's a gesture, but hardly a nice one.

115
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,014
- Why not?
- She'll have to refuse it.

116
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,374
- Why?
- Quarantine!

117
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,817
You can't import dogs!
It'll have to spend six months in quarantine.

118
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,777
The French will understand, won't they?

119
00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:00,410
They'll understand it privately,
but they'll refuse to understand it officially.

120
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,457
The Foreign Office must sort it out. Get Peter.

121
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:09,649
Humphrey, they're creating a diplomatic incident
so they can get their own way over the tunnel.

122
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,731
Of course, Prime Minister!

123
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,094
- Peter, you've heard the news?
- Yes.

124
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,489
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

125
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,889
You're my Foreign Affairs Secretary.

126
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,415
Yes, but the Home Office
is responsible for quarantine.

127
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,810
Get Graham.
Can't you get them to withdraw this gift?

128
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:34,292
We've suggested a painting of the puppy,
a bronze, a porcelain model. Not a hope.

129
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,451
- Couldn't you get them to stuff it?
- Well...

130
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,087
Oh, taxidermy. No, no chance.

131
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,457
Tell the Home Office they must find a way
round quarantine regulations.

132
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,531
- Out of the question.
- What do you mean?

133
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:52,489
We enforce them vigorously
with all British citizens and foreign nationals.

134
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:56,254
Also the Quarantine Act
is signed by the Queen.

135
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,128
She can't be the only one to break
her own laws. Out of the question.

136
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:05,217
- The French ambassador's here.
- Ask him to wait for a moment.

137
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,577
Get back to the Foreign Office.
Say we've got to find a way round this.

138
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:15,848
Keep in touch with Bernard. Bernard, liaise
with the palace. Humphrey, coordinate it all.

139
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,534
- I'll set up an operations room.
- Anything else we ought to do?

140
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:25,296
- I think you should see the ambassador now.
- OK, wheel him in. Don't you go, Humphrey!

141
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,771
- Do I need any papers?
- No, just a sponge and a towel.

142
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:33,648
- His Excellency, the French ambassador.
- Excellency.

143
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,607
- You're most kind to give me your time.
- Enchant?

144
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,608
You're anxious to finalise the agreement
for the tunnel?

145
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,339
Very much so. In fact...

146
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,208
- There's no real hurry. It would be nice if...
- Quite.

147
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,167
My government feels that
if we took advantage of the funeral...

148
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,049
- My condolences, by the way. A tragic loss.
- Oh, tragic, tragic.

149
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,337
If we took advantage of the funeral
for you and our President to speak...

150
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:10,256
Of course, I will be host to a large number
of distinguished people. It may not be easy.

151
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,172
You do not wish to speak to our President?

152
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,174
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.
Well, yes... and no.

153
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,058
Speak, yes, of course, but negotiate...

154
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:27,533
Don't you think these quarrels between friends
are best resolved by just talking together?

155
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,259
Between friends, yes.

156
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,174
Otherwise the President may be hurt.
Not personally, but as a snub to France.

157
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,614
No intention. Great friends.

158
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,807
Excellent. The second point is the security
of our embassy during the visit.

159
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,209
Yes, everything's in hand.

160
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,975
My government requests that the French police
be permitted to guard the embassy.

161
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,178
- French police? No, that's not possible.
- It is surely not impossible?

162
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,333
- Don't you trust the British police?
- We make no comment on the British police.

163
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:04,368
But our President would be happier
if the French police were in charge.

164
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:09,897
The problem, Excellency, is that there are
well over a hundred embassies in London.

165
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,849
No doubt they'd all want their own police.
Most of them would carry machine guns.

166
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,409
Her Majesty's government is not...
totally convinced

167
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,571
that that would make London a safer place.

168
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,416
My government will be most disappointed.

169
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,217
But now I can turn to a happy matter.

170
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,249
Our President will be bringing a little present
which he will be presenting to Her Majesty.

171
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:40,732
- How charming.
- A little puppy. Her name is Cocotte.

172
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,536
Cocotte.

173
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,376
She comes from the litter of the same Labrador
that Her Majesty presented to the President

174
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:54,054
on her last state visit to France.

175
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,096
Let him know the arrangements
for the presentation.

176
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,697
Oh, delightful thought. The presentation
won't be possible for another six months.

177
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,657
- Our quarantine laws.
- Absurd.

178
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,609
Your Queen gave her dog during her visit.
Why can our President not do the same?

179
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,533
Delightful thought, nothing we'd rather...
but the law is the law.

180
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:21,331
- Surely it exists to exclude infected animals?
- Er... yes.

181
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:26,493
Do you suggest the President of France
would present the Queen of England

182
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,854
with a diseased puppy?

183
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,453
- No, no, no...
- Then it is settled.

184
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,976
No, it is not. Suggest to your President
that he brings a different gift.

185
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,575
Out of the question.
Were it the President alone, perhaps.

186
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:46,177
The President's wife, our first lady,
has set her heart on it. She is determined.

187
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:49,536
We'll make every effort,
but it may not be possible.

188
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,489
I cannot tell you the gravity of the affront
my government would feel

189
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,450
if Her Majesty were to refuse a gift in exchange
for the one our President accepted from her.

190
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:05,613
I fear it would be interpreted
as both a national and a personal affront

191
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,770
to the President and his wife.

192
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,972
Excellency, you must ask the President
not to bring that bitch with him.

193
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,937
No, no, the puppy.

194
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,090
I meant the puppy.

195
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,810
We have to lay on visits for the wives.

196
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,176
The Foreign Office like it.
Keeps them out of the way.

197
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,331
- Why can't they be with their husbands?
- They're busy.

198
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:35,969
- Only at the funeral.
- They're not coming for the funeral.

199
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,291
They're coming here for the politics.
This is a working funeral.

200
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:45,408
At that funeral in Norway, we were all so busy,
the French, Germans and I,

201
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,730
talking about quotas,
we forgot to go to the cathedral.

202
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,290
- Did they notice?
- They noticed, all right. We got there late.

203
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,452
Blamed security. You can blame security
for anything nowadays.

204
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:02,329
- So this funeral will be a sort of summit.
- Yes. It's a heaven-sent opportunity.

205
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:05,297
- Literally.
- Yes.

206
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,769
Better than a summit
because there are no expectations.

207
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:13,933
People don't expect leaders to come back
with test-ban agreements or quota reductions,

208
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:17,296
so we can have some meaningful discussions.

209
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,931
- A summit is just a public-relations circus.
- Isn't anyone coming to pay tribute to a friend?

210
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:28,093
A friend? If only his friends came to the abbey,
we wouldn't even fill the vestry.

211
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:34,409
He's done much more for the world by dying
than he ever did in the whole of his life.

212
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,570
Have you agreed the service?

213
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:38,934
- Yeah, lots of music.
- That's nice.

214
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:43,490
Mm, you can have useful discussions
when the organ's playing.

215
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,288
- Have to shut up for the lesson.
- What about the sermon?

216
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,212
That's when you catch up on jet lag.

217
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,418
This funeral's come at the right moment.

218
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,891
We've all sorts to discuss - about NATO,
the Warsaw Pact, the Middle East.

219
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,493
And what if you don't sort it all out?

220
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:06,653
We'll just have to hope that before too long
somebody else important snuffs it.

221
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,730
I've spoken to the Home Office.

222
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,689
They say there's no grounds to pass an act
to allow this dog into Britain.

223
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,453
I know an enabling act can enable anything,

224
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:21,737
but the PM feels it would merely enable him
to lose the next election.

225
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:28,338
Have you thought of turning Buckingham Palace
into a quarantine zone for dogs? Just a thought.

226
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,649
- What about the corgis?
- (PHONE)

227
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,813
Hang on. Graham, check with the palace
that Her Majesty's not been told officially

228
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:39,972
that this gift's been proposed,
then she can't be implicated in refusing it.

229
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,858
Yes, we will want simultaneous translators.

230
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,013
Er, no, not when the PM meets the leaders
of English-speaking nations.

231
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:51,967
- (PHONE)
- Yes, they can be said to include the US...

232
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,171
...with a certain generosity of spirit. Got to go.

233
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,730
Yes, 10 Prime Ministers are flying in today.
Special Branch are going crazy.

234
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,892
So is the Royal Marines band who play
all the national anthems.

235
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:09,575
- I see. Argentina's not coming. A bit of luck.
- Because of the Falklands?

236
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:13,732
No, because their anthem goes on
for about six minutes.

237
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,891
I know you're worried about this dog. So am I.

238
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,179
Talk to our ambassador in Paris.
See if he can think of a way to nobble it.

239
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,331
You know, slip it something.

240
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:29,651
See if the Bulgarians have got
any spare umbrella tips.

241
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:36,258
If we made the palace an extension of the French
embassy, the dog would be on foreign territory.

242
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,411
The PM is fighting
for the sovereignty of the tunnel.

243
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:42,616
- (PHONE)
- How would he feel about palace sovereignty?

244
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:48,490
How do you think the sovereign would feel? No,
we can't have alphabetical seating in the abbey.

245
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,696
You'd have Iraq and Iran next to each other.

246
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:57,333
Plus Israel and Jordan all sitting in the same pew.

247
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:00,696
We'd be in danger of starting World War III.

248
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:05,057
I know Ireland begins with an I,
but it doesn't make it any better.

249
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,211
Ireland doesn't make anything any better.

250
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:14,170
If the papal envoy says, "We desire to wash
our hands", it means he wants a pee.

251
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,173
Yes, a royal "we", followed by a royal flush.

252
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,334
Watch out for the South Africans.

253
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:25,811
- Problems with human rights?
- No, they're trying to unload grapefruit.

254
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,767
The palace wants to know
if there's a problem about the red carpets.

255
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:34,615
The Ivory Coast wishes to award Her Majesty
with the Order of the Elephant.

256
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,772
Hang on. We can't have another animal,
especially an elephant.

257
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:42,409
Whitehall, the Home Office,
Foreign Office, the DHSS,

258
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,095
have been tied up with one puppy
for nearly a week! No elephants!

259
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,094
The mode of address to a Cypriot archbishop
is not Your Ecstasy, it's Your Beatitude.

260
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,649
- (BUZZER)
- For God's sake, what is it...

261
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,970
Oh, sorry, Prime Minister.
I'll come in straight away.

262
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,448
- What on earth is that?
- The Channel Tunnel file.

263
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,816
- No, no, the other one.
- That's the puppy file.

264
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,570
- Where have we got to?
- It weighed in at three and a half pounds.

265
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:22,094
- The puppy?
- No, the file.

266
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,978
- What's happening?
- We've told the French

267
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:29,257
that airport security
will have to keep the puppy in quarantine.

268
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,410
- What do they say?
- No reply yet.

269
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:35,811
It is on the route from the palace to Windsor,
so the Queen could visit it.

270
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:41,576
- Can you visit quarantined dogs?
- Well, if she can't, she can sort of wave to it.

271
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,134
- What do you think they'll do?
- Threaten to publish the story

272
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,335
if we don't give in on the tunnel.

273
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,094
- I have urgent news.
- I hope it's good news.

274
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,854
Yes and no. The police found a bomb
in the French embassy grounds.

275
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,697
- What?! Who put it there?
- We don't know yet.

276
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,568
- Lots of people could have a motive.
- Me, for a start.

277
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,617
It's a good thing we found it... I suppose.

278
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,091
The other news is worse.
The President is not flying in for the funeral.

279
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,457
- That's marvellous!
- He's not flying, he's driving! Secretly!

280
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,328
- The plane is just going to be a decoy.
- Good idea.

281
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,889
- A brilliant idea! He can bring the puppy!
- No!

282
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,655
Are you prepared to give permission
for his car to be stopped and searched?

283
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:35,097
Will you violate their diplomatic immunity
and search the diplomatic bag?

284
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:39,730
- Even they wouldn't put a puppy in a bag.
- It'd be a doggy bag.

285
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,731
If we found it,
that'd put the cat among the pigeons.

286
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,618
Let the dog out of the bag.

287
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,648
- But just suppose it wasn't there?
- Yeah. I can't take the risk.

288
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,209
If it was there,
they'll drive into the French embassy

289
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:02,169
and that puppy will be on French territory here,
right in the middle of London!

290
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,332
- Hanging over our heads.
- Better pray it's house-trained.

291
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:20,727
I'm so sorry, would you excuse
the Prime Minister?

292
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,057
We have a problem. Have you spoken
to the French President yet?

293
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,291
- A couple of well-chosen words.
- What, precisely?

294
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,450
Bonsoir, actually.

295
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:36,577
You can't put it off. It'll be one more thing
for him to take offence at.

296
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,730
He can't be that easily offended, can he?

297
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,687
No, but in exchange
for dropping this dog nonsense,

298
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:46,408
they want sovereignty over the tunnel
from the three-mile limit.

299
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,809
- Absurd.
- That's the negotiating position.

300
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,972
They'll concede to a 50-50 split
midway across the Channel

301
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:58,930
if we agree to French as the first language
on all signs, information, menus, everything.

302
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,091
- French comes before English.
- Must I concede?

303
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,457
- If you want your foundation-stone ceremony.
- All right. Where is he?

304
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,817
Mrs Hacker, have you met
Monsieur Berenger from UNESCO?

305
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:14,289
Such a good funeral.
Much better than Andropov's.

306
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,849
- That was gloomy.
- So glad you're enjoying it.

307
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:22,012
- Prime Minister, got a minute?
- The American Vice President.

308
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:26,377
I was talking to the Soviets.
Gromyko's got a great Polish joke.

309
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,770
- What is it?
- Jaruzelski! (LAUGHS LOUDLY)

310
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,849
Commissioner... can I introduce you
to Monsieur Berenger from UNESCO?

311
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,614
UNESCO? Ah, yes. Gallant little country.

312
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,692
- Ah, Sir Humphrey!
- You remember the Soviet ambassador.

313
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:53,013
You know, the death of the past Prime Minister
is a very sad occasion.

314
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,775
- Oh, yes, yes, very sad...
- But it is no loss for Britain.

315
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,529
- You know what his trouble was?
- Hm?

316
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:06,169
He had plenty here, plenty here...

317
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:08,375
...but nothing here!
- Ahh!

318
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,052
Yes, Bernard?

319
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:15,211
Forgive me, I must talk to our French friends.

320
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,815
I did want to talk to you
about the NATO bases in Germany.

321
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:22,574
- Tomorrow, Westminster Abbey.
- You got a deal.

322
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:26,857
- You need to see this security file.
- I'm about to talk to the President.

323
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,010
You should see this file first.

324
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,854
That bomb in the French embassy
was planted by the French police.

325
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:35,817
You're not serious? Why?

326
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:41,576
- To catch us out, prove our security inefficient.
- Smuggling explosives into the UK?

327
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:43,730
- Correct.
- Got proof?

328
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,211
- We found a detonator in their hotel.
- This is wonderful!

329
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:54,090
Give me two minutes alone with the President.
When I give you a signal, bring that file in.

330
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:56,409
What will the signal be?

331
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:58,058
Um...

332
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,254
I'm so sorry, Monsieur le President.
I'm sure he's just coming.

333
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,729
Monsieur le President... the tunnel.

334
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:15,610
Indeed, but first of all, can we clear up
this misunderstanding about the puppy

335
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,532
which I am presenting to Her Majesty tomorrow?

336
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:22,248
I'm very sorry,
but I can't ask her to break the law.

337
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:27,732
I do not want the Queen to break the law.
I merely ask the Prime Minister to bend it.

338
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,494
I'm deeply sorry. If I possibly could.

339
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,653
If the French people learn of this rejection,
a national slap in the face...

340
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,493
- The tunnel.
- The tunnel? You make it difficult for me.

341
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,129
The French will not accept
a second slap in the face

342
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,295
and you are rejecting our very reasonable
proposal for French sovereignty as far as Dover.

343
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,019
However, setting that to one side,

344
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:59,207
there is the question of which shall be
la langue de pr閒閞ence, the first language.

345
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:03,975
Sir Humphrey, I have just seen
this order of service for tomorrow.

346
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:06,892
It is deeply embarrassing. This hymn.

347
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:12,450
"On Jordan's Bank, The Baptist's Cry"? Why?

348
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:16,817
Don't you know
the Jordan Bank went bust yesterday?

349
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,173
Surely, if we have half the signs
in French first and half the signs in English...

350
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,171
...that's fair?
- It's not logical.

351
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,457
- Does logic matter?
- Does law matter?

352
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,215
Yes. Britain is the only country in Europe
still... free of rabies.

353
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,697
Bernard will handle this for you. Bernard...

354
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:49,335
Monsieur le President, will you forgive me?
Prime Minister, I think you ought to see this.

355
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:53,253
No, I don't believe it!

356
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:58,208
Mr President, I shall have to ask you
to explain this.

357
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:05,090
I need hardly say how grave this matter is.

358
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:09,298
Prime Minister, I ask you to believe
I had no knowledge of this.

359
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:12,895
An attempt by a guest
to deceive our government?

360
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,414
Smuggling explosives into the UK?

361
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:21,848
You must know that the French government
never knows what French security are doing.

362
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,011
- You can't take responsibility for them?
- That's not what I mean.

363
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,376
If this report is true, accept my profound regrets.

364
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,737
- It's true enough, I'm afraid.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

365
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:39,370
It makes it so difficult for the Prime Minister...
over the Channel Tunnel.

366
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,532
After news of this bomb, the British
will want to make few concessions.

367
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:46,896
They won't know whether
it's safe to... go through.

368
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,495
- It could be full of official French bombs.
- Absolument.

369
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,929
Of course, in the interests
of Anglo-French friendship,

370
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:58,489
we could overlook the crimes
of your security men.

371
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:03,050
I suppose... sovereignty halfway across?

372
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,017
I'll just write that down, if I may.

373
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:11,410
Half the signs in English first
and the ceremony in two months... in Dover.

374
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:18,090
As an expression of the enduring warmth
and trust between our two countries.

375
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,697
Let us have a draft communiqu?tomorrow.

376
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,009
Mais oui, Prime Minister.
