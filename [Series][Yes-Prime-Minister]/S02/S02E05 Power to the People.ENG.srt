1
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:43,689
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:47,168
You have to leave for the TV studios
in five minutes.

3
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,650
- Do you remember what the interview's about?
- Local government.

4
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,013
The one thing I can do nothing about.

5
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:58,968
These wretched councils are run by a bunch
of corrupt morons who are too clever by half.

6
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:04,496
The most a moron can be is less clever by half.
These councillors are democratically elected.

7
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:09,448
Depends how you define democracy. Only
about 25% of people vote in a local election.

8
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,896
Those who do regard it as a popularity pole
for the real leaders in Westminster.

9
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:18,256
- But councillors are still representatives.
- Who do they represent?

10
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:22,172
Nobody knows who their councillor is.
Do you know who yours is?

11
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:25,057
- No.
- Well, no, of course you don't.

12
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,209
The councillors know this,

13
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:32,168
so they spend four totally unaccountable years
on a publicly subsidised ego trip.

14
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:35,887
They ruin the inner cities,
let the schools fall to bits,

15
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:40,051
they demoralise the police
and undermine law and order, then blame me.

16
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:44,328
- Will you say that?
- I've just said it. Didn't you hear me?

17
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:49,888
- No, I mean on television.
- Of course not. It'd make me sound intolerant.

18
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,696
Houndsworth Council leader, Agnes Moorhouse,

19
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:57,567
threatens to withhold police funds
and ban them from council property.

20
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:01,048
She can't do that.
Section 5 of the Police Act, 1964.

21
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:04,608
Councils must provide
an adequate and efficient police force.

22
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:09,488
She says that until the police force is 50% black,
it can't be adequate or efficient.

23
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,166
- She can't prove that.
- Unfortunately, her own police force

24
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:17,728
is the most inadequate and least efficient
in the country.

25
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:21,288
- Everybody's terrified that she will prove it.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)

26
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:26,013
Humphrey, we've got to do something
about Agnes Moorhouse.

27
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:29,170
- Her borough's practically a no-go area.
- Indeed.

28
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:32,569
- What?
- How about a strongly worded letter?

29
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:37,937
And get a more strongly worded letter in reply,
copied to the newspapers? Asking for trouble.

30
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,408
- Draw her attention to the law.
- She is a lawyer.

31
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:46,094
- Getting round the law is what she's paid for.
- Why not just ignore her?

32
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:50,968
Have everyone say I'd handed over control
of the inner cities to the militant loonies?

33
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:55,973
She's a wild woman, Humphrey.
No, someone's got to have a word with her.

34
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:59,210
- Point out the security implications.
- A law officer?

35
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:02,848
No. Can't be a political confrontation.
Has to be an official.

36
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:07,330
Somebody with responsibility for security.

37
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:10,376
(MUTTERS) Somebody with responsibility...

38
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:15,330
No, no, no, no, Prime Minister, no!
She's a monster!

39
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:20,891
No, i-i-it's up to Scotland Yard, the Home Office,
the Security Branch, er, Special Branch, I mean,

40
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:25,734
the... the Ml5, the Lord Chancellor,
Department of the Environment...

41
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,970
- The White Fish Authority?
- White Fish... No, no, no!

42
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:32,335
- Don't you coordinate the security services?
- Yes, yes...

43
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:37,208
- Or should we give that job to someone else?
- No, no, no, no, no.

44
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,417
That's agreed, then. A quiet word.
Come to a gentlemen's agreement.

45
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,773
But she's not a gentleman!

46
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:45,929
She's not even a lady!

47
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:50,089
I want YOU to handle her. Come on.

48
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:53,135
Handle her?

49
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,446
- Agnes Moorhouse to see you, Sir Humphrey.
- Right.

50
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:10,813
Oh, my dear lady, how very nice to meet you.
Come in. Won't you come and sit down? Now...

51
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:18,495
Um... right... Would you get Miss Moorhouse
a cup of tea. Or is it Mrs Moorhouse?

52
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,488
- Is my marital status really your concern?
- Er, no, no.

53
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:26,412
It's just... You know, I was just... worried
about whether the... er...

54
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,570
Er, would you get... her a cup of tea?

55
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:36,413
- What should I call you? Ms Moorhouse?
- Call me Agnes. What shall I call you?

56
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:38,409
Um...

57
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,297
...well, you can call me Sir Humphrey.

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,449
Now, my dear lady...

59
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:49,134
I'm not your "dear lady". Don't patronise me
and cut out the sexist crap, OK?

60
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,968
Er... OK, Agnes.

61
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:59,529
I wanted us to have this meeting
so we could try and understand one another.

62
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,132
- I'm sure we're in agreement.
- Really?

63
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:05,495
You have your own views
about how Britain should be run,

64
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:09,207
but I'm sure we agree on a fundamental basis
of order and authority.

65
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:11,812
- That's half true.
- Half true?

66
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,414
- You agree, I don't.
- But it's obvious!

67
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:20,777
Yes, if you've got it made under this system,
you use authority to preserve your privileges.

68
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:24,328
What about the homeless,
the unemployed, the poor?

69
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,454
I know all about them.

70
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,815
- (HUMPHREY CHUCKLES)
- Really? What do you know?

71
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:34,369
I've read all the published papers.
I've seen all the statistics.

72
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,575
Believe me, dear lady... Agnes, I... I...

73
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,930
- I do know all about them.
- Fine.

74
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:45,090
What does half a pound of margarine cost?

75
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:49,493
- What?
- What does half a pound of margarine cost?

76
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:52,092
Oh... er... How should I know? Er... 20p.

77
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:56,331
- 20p?!
- ?.40! I don't know!

78
00:05:56,498 --> 00:06:00,696
Right. Why should you?
What time do Social Security offices open?

79
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:06,533
How long can you run a one-bar fire
with 50 pence in the meter?

80
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,689
I'm not entirely sure I follow.

81
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:13,886
If you knew that, you wouldn't agree about
using authority to support the system.

82
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:18,529
I do understand. I do sympathise.
It'd be marvellous if there was no poverty.

83
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:22,168
- But we haven't the resources to achieve that.
- Who hasn't?

84
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:25,330
- The nation.
- Really?

85
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:30,851
Does this desk belong to the nation?
This china?

86
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,055
- Porcelain.
- Porcelain.

87
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:39,008
- These portraits? Or are they your own?
- They're government property.

88
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:42,773
Oh, good.
They should fetch about - what? - 80,000.

89
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:46,897
That'll keep 20 one-parent families for a year.
What about your salary?

90
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:51,449
- That has nothing to do with it!
- Good, then we'll have that, too.

91
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:55,213
Leave you ?00 a week.
That's 70,000 a year for the needy.

92
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:59,496
My salary is merely part of
a complex economic structure.

93
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,455
We'll simplify it.

94
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:06,533
After all, you don't want to make a profit
out of serving your country, do you?

95
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,655
Ah, tea.

96
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,217
Over here, Eileen. Um...

97
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:18,973
How very nice. Thank you so much.
Shall I be mother?

98
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:27,416
Tell me, um... Agnes...

99
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:32,527
...this policy of yours
of only allowing free-range eggs

100
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:35,770
to be sold in your borough,
how does this help poverty?

101
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:41,251
Animals have rights too, you know.
A battery chicken's life isn't worth living.

102
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:46,253
Would you want to spend your life packed in
with 600 other squawking, smelly creatures,

103
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:50,206
unable to breathe fresh air,
unable to move, unable to think?

104
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:54,132
Certainly not.
That's why I never stood for Parliament.

105
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,415
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

106
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:01,776
Now, let's turn to this matter of the police.

107
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:07,012
You want to withhold funds from the police,
ban them from council property,

108
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,966
sack the Chief Constable,
and allow several no-go areas.

109
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:14,847
- That's it.
- But can't you see

110
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:19,728
that an adequate police enforcement
is in all our interests?

111
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:24,813
And it is especially in the interests
of all those poor, ordinary folk

112
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,050
who dwell in the high-crime housing estates.

113
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,527
- I don't accept that.
- Oh.

114
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:34,771
You want them to be in danger
of being mugged and raped and bombed?

115
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:38,135
- Can't be helped.
- But this could lead to the overthrow

116
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:42,689
- of our system of government, our way of life!
- Yours, not theirs.

117
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,850
- You would be happy to abolish Parliament?
- Yes.

118
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,815
- The courts?
- Yes.

119
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,538
- The monarchy?!
- Of course.

120
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:56,692
Perhaps you'd like to burn down my office!
That matches are over here!

121
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,372
- No, certainly not.
- Why?

122
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,689
I may need it.

123
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:08,293
- You know that Agnes Moorhouse woman?
- Yes?

124
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,736
- I told Humphrey to have a word with her.
- Interesting experiment.

125
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:17,926
He says it went well, but he didn't want to talk
about it and had four whiskies in ten minutes.

126
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,933
What is it about local government?

127
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:26,092
I've had trouble with the town hall. They've
cancelled the old people's Christmas party.

128
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:30,137
- Why?
- New staff overtime agreements.

129
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:34,769
"It's your husband's fault. Tell him to give us
the money and you can have the party."

130
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:39,932
Every piece of stupidity and incompetence
in every town hall in Britain is blamed on me.

131
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,089
- (DOORBELL)
- That'll be Dorothy.

132
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:48,049
I asked her up here to have a word
about that very thing. Dorothy, come in.

133
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:53,212
Come and sit down. Now, tell me,
what is wrong with local government?

134
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:56,051
Well, it's a them-and-us situation.

135
00:09:56,218 --> 00:10:00,211
- The local authority ought to be us.
- Us the people or us the government?

136
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:04,371
- In a democracy that ought to be the same thing.
- We all know it isn't.

137
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,531
I mean us, the people.
They ought to be running things for us.

138
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:14,091
But they're running things for them. For their
power, their convenience and their benefit.

139
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,726
- I know that.
- So what's the answer?

140
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,935
- Fight them.
- No. Make them us.

141
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,727
- How do you mean?
- How do you stop a major government project?

142
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:25,889
Join the Civil Service.

143
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,174
If you're an ordinary person.

144
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:34,571
- I can't remember what that was like.
- Judging from opinion polls, you'll soon find out.

145
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:38,970
- Just imagine you're an ordinary person, Jim.
- Well, I'll try.

146
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:44,337
Imagine you want to stop a road-widening scheme
or an airport being built. What do you do?

147
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,058
- Write to your MP.
- That does the trick?

148
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:51,848
Of course not, but that's what ordinary people do
'cause ordinary people are stupid.

149
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,806
- Is that why they elected you?
- Stop barracking, darling, please.

150
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,776
I'm trying to understand
what Dorothy's driving at.

151
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:03,090
Ordinary people form a group
to fight official plans they don't want

152
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,977
and this group represents the local people.

153
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,936
This group is different from the local authority

154
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:12,852
because the local authority
doesn't really represent the local people.

155
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:17,409
- Why not?
- Councillors are all drawn from tiny local parties.

156
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,776
When a local community really cares
about an issue, they form a committee,

157
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:25,931
and then they talk to people
in the supermarkets and on the doorstep.

158
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,532
They drum up support and raise money.

159
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:34,091
And this money isn't like the rates. It's spent
on what people actually want it spent on.

160
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:38,410
I bet ordinary people would like
the old folks to have a Christmas party.

161
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,376
The town hall would rather have a new town hall

162
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:45,053
or a councillors' fact-finding mission
to the Bahamas.

163
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:48,528
- What do you do?
- It's obvious. Abolish them.

164
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:51,496
Invest all power in the central government.

165
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:55,412
- That's exactly what Humphrey would say.
- See? What?

166
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,776
Jim, you've completely missed the point
of everything I've been saying.

167
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:05,570
The idea is to return power to ordinary people
and take it away from the town-hall machine.

168
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:09,413
- Make local government genuinely accountable.
- Yes, but how?

169
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:13,890
It's all in an article in this month's
"Political Review" by Professor Marriott.

170
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,856
Now, you create little voting districts.

171
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:22,012
200 or so households electing
their own little parish council, a city village.

172
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:27,730
The chairman of this little parish council
is their representative on the local authority.

173
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:30,856
You'd have about 500 councillors
to each borough.

174
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,215
That's right. So they'd elect an executive council.

175
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,768
The local authority would have
a parliament and a cabinet.

176
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,135
Parliament don't elect the Cabinet.
We don't want that.

177
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:45,610
- That'd be taking participation to extreme lengths.
- These councils would.

178
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,011
Each councillor would be in door-to-door contact
with the people who voted for him.

179
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:55,649
Dorothy, this could be like
the Great Reform Act of 1832.

180
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,730
These councils are like old rotten boroughs.

181
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:03,050
Half a dozen people deciding who'll be
in the town hall for the next four years.

182
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:06,654
- Precisely.
- And I shall be the great reformer!

183
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:11,010
Hacker's Reform Bill. I shall introduce it myself.

184
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:15,966
The power of this country
does not lie in offices and institutions,

185
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:21,258
it lies in the stout hearts and strong wills
of the yeomen of Britain!

186
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:24,216
Women have the vote, too!

187
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,369
The yeowomen of Britain.

188
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:30,176
Yeopersons. Yeopeople? No.

189
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,136
...the people of this island race.

190
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,493
On their broad and wise shoulders...

191
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:37,694
You can't have wise shoulders.

192
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:43,091
On their broad shoulders
and wise hearts... heads...

193
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:46,568
In their wise heads lies our destiny.

194
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,536
We must give back power to the people!

195
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,008
And I shall be the one to introduce this... um...

196
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,328
What shall I call this new scheme?

197
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,648
Democracy?

198
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:05,010
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yes, Bernard.

199
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,649
Bernard, I want to have a word with you
about Professor Marriott's article.

200
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:13,015
- I think it's time we reformed local government.
- Do you?

201
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:14,975
Yes.

202
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,249
At least I think I did.

203
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:23,092
That is, I'm not wholly against it.

204
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:30,128
Although there are many... convincing, some
might say conclusive, arguments against it.

205
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,687
Some might indeed, Bernard.

206
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,610
Yes. Why?

207
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:36,848
Because once you create

208
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:41,409
genuinely democratic local communities,
it won't stop there.

209
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:44,615
- Won't it?
- Well, of course it won't.

210
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:49,977
You see, once they get established,
they'll insist on more power.

211
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:54,893
Politicians will be too frightened to withhold them,
so you'll get regional government.

212
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:59,051
- Would that matter?
- Bernard, come and sit down.

213
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:05,048
What happens at the moment if there is
some vacant land in, say, Nottingham

214
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:09,177
and there are rival proposals for its use -
hospital, college, airport?

215
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:15,527
We set up an inter-departmental committee.
Health, Education, Transport, Environment.

216
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:20,249
Ask for papers, hold meetings, propose,
discuss, revise, report back, re-draft.

217
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:23,808
Precisely. Months of fruitful work.

218
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,730
Leading to a mature and responsible conclusion.

219
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:33,289
But if you have regional government,
they decide it all in Nottingham!

220
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,246
Probably in a couple of meetings!
Complete amateurs!

221
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,649
- It is their city.
- And what happens to us?

222
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:44,970
- Well, much less work.
- Yes, much less work!

223
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:50,610
So little that ministers might be able to do it
on their own, so we'd have much less power!

224
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,334
I don't know if I want power.

225
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:57,093
If the right people don't have power,
know what happens?

226
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,249
The wrong people get it!

227
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:07,097
- Politicians, councillors, ordinary voters!
- But aren't they supposed to in a democracy?

228
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:12,048
- This is a British democracy, Bernard!
- How do you mean?

229
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:16,052
British democracy recognises
that you need a system

230
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,686
to protect the important things of life

231
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:22,248
and keep them out of the hands of the barbarians!

232
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,369
Things like the opera...

233
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,295
...Radio 3...

234
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:33,338
...the countryside... the law...

235
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,374
...the universities.

236
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,529
Both of them.

237
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,334
- And we are that system.
- Gosh!

238
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:48,491
We run a civilised, aristocratic
government machine

239
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:51,616
tempered by occasional general elections.

240
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:58,451
Since 1832, we have been gradually
excluding the voter from government.

241
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:03,009
Now we've got them to a point
where they just vote once every five years

242
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:06,648
for which buffoons
will try to interfere with OUR policies

243
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,537
and you are happy to see all that thrown away?

244
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,654
Well, no, no, I didn't mean...

245
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:16,812
Bernard, do you want the Lake District
turned into a gigantic caravan site?

246
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,016
The Royal Opera House into a bingo hall?

247
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:27,216
The National Theatre
into a carpet sale warehouse?

248
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,608
Well, it looks like one, actually.

249
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:35,891
We gave the architect a knighthood
so that nobody would ever say that.

250
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:45,449
Do you want Radio 3 to broadcast pop music
24 hours a day?

251
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:49,611
How would you feel if they took
all the culture programmes off television?

252
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,090
- I never watch them.
- Neither do I, but it's vital to know they're there!

253
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,175
You said local government was corrupt
and incompetent.

254
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:04,334
So it is, Bernard. So corrupt and incompetent
that even ministers recognise it.

255
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,092
Which means that they centralise.

256
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:11,092
They give all the responsible jobs to us.

257
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,456
We... are the flower of government, Bernard.

258
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:19,096
Local government may be a dunghill...

259
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,768
...but it grows beautiful roses.

260
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,775
You mean...

261
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,214
Yes, that's right, Bernard.

262
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:34,371
But if we try to clean up the dunghill

263
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:38,133
and... lose our balance...

264
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:42,086
- We land in the...
- Thank you, Bernard.

265
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,487
That's very good of you. Thank you.

266
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,768
So you see why I'm so worried, Arnold.

267
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:58,331
This Marriott scheme is the thin end of the wedge.
It could eventually undermine the Civil Service.

268
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:03,014
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of that.
Not if you play it right.

269
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,171
Hacker's just grasping at straws.

270
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:12,571
It's the old logical fallacy.
All cats have four legs. My dog has four legs...

271
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:16,138
Therefore my dog is a cat.

272
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,057
He's suffering from politician's logic.

273
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,051
Something must be done therefore we must do it.

274
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:26,415
But doing the wrong thing
is worse than doing nothing.

275
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,297
Doing anything is worse than doing nothing.

276
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:34,926
After all, what is the one thing that obsesses
politicians throughout their careers?

277
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:40,047
Well, obviously publicity and popularity.
Name in the paper, face on the telly.

278
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:43,210
- Anything to help get them re-elected.
- Quite.

279
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:48,577
Government is fame and glory and importance
and big offices and chauffeurs

280
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:51,730
and being interviewed by Terry Wogan.

281
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:56,693
Opposition is impotence and insignificance

282
00:19:56,858 --> 00:20:00,168
and people at parties asking you
if you know Robin Day.

283
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:07,212
But, Arnold, reforming the Civil Service
might win them popularity.

284
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:11,408
But it can't ever happen... can it, Humphrey?

285
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:16,252
- Er... why not, Arnold?
It's the same as in local government.

286
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:20,889
Constituencies of 60,000 are far too big
for people to know their MP.

287
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,654
Electors make up their minds on the basis
of the telly and the radio and the press.

288
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:28,616
Yes, they pick their favourite party leader,

289
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:34,569
then they vote for whatever clown a few people
in their party have chosen as their candidate.

290
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:39,175
- I do understand how the system works, Arnold.
- But do you?

291
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:45,052
Listen, Humphrey, if a politician lives or dies
by his media image,

292
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:49,052
then his survival depends on
the Civil Service publicity machine

293
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:56,090
helping him with his fatuous speeches
and articles and photo opportunities.

294
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,977
Politicians are dependent on us.

295
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:03,529
A thousand press officers to publicise
their little triumphs.

296
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:08,294
The Official Secrets Act to conceal
their daily disasters.

297
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:12,966
So what you're saying is that
under Professor Marriott's scheme,

298
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:18,576
MPs would be elected on their local reputation
rather than on their leader's media image.

299
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:22,731
Yes, governments and ministers
would have to earn their votes.

300
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:27,210
Actually do what the electors want
instead of leaving us to do it our way

301
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,369
while they do the fame and glory bit.

302
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,976
Frightening thought.

303
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:36,208
Frightening to us,
but what about the Prime Minister?

304
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,566
Of course. Even more frightening.

305
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:45,447
Reforming the Civil Service would remove
his life-support system.

306
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:49,968
It would kick away the ladder
that's put him where he is.

307
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:53,050
While he's still standing on it.

308
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,769
That's right.

309
00:21:55,938 --> 00:22:01,058
The only way to reform the Civil Service system
is to reform the political system.

310
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:05,211
No government's going to reform
the system that put it into power.

311
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:10,926
The thing is to get the Prime Minister
to see the danger.

312
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:13,089
That's your job.

313
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:19,570
I know. I'll tell him it'll be
the most courageous thing he's ever done.

314
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,893
That always does the trick.

315
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,413
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Yes?

316
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:31,776
- Agnes Moorhouse, Sir Humphrey.
- Ah, Agnes.

317
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:33,929
Why don't you sit over here?

318
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:41,253
Agnes, the Prime Minister's really worried
about your attitude to the police.

319
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:43,010
Oh, good.

320
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:49,575
So he's proposing a wholesale reform
of local government.

321
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:54,257
Street representatives,
voting communities of 200 households,

322
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:59,412
total involvement of the borough electorate
in the selection of candidates.

323
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,615
- This isn't serious?
- Oh, I'm afraid it is.

324
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:08,293
This strikes at the heart
of our democratic social reforms.

325
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,770
Do you mean the people
don't want your policies?

326
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:18,934
Of course they would if they could understand,
but the ordinary voters are simple people.

327
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,693
They don't see their needs.
They can't analyse problems.

328
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,577
They need leadership to guide them.

329
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,617
And don't you think "the people"
would vote for such leadership?

330
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:36,729
- People don't understand what's good for them.
- Oh... I do so agree with you.

331
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,613
- Do you?
- Of course!

332
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,771
That's how the Civil Service
has survived for centuries.

333
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:48,216
We made this country what it is,
but nobody would ever vote for us!

334
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:52,368
- We know what's right for this country!
- So do we!

335
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:57,453
The only way is to have a small group in charge
and let the people have a vote every few years.

336
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:00,451
If they knew the people they were voting for...

337
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:05,214
If they actually talked to them,
they'd fall for all the silly conventional ideas!

338
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:08,293
- Humphrey...
- Agnes?

339
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,492
This would be a disaster for you, too.

340
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,569
I know.

341
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:18,128
Community councils always lead
to regional government.

342
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,257
Agnes... we must stop the Prime Minister!

343
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:26,966
- You want to stop him, too?
- Of course. And you must help me.

344
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:30,733
- How?
- Well, I think I know how to do it.

345
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:35,130
I want your written assurance
that you will stop harassing your local police.

346
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:39,610
I mean, stop making them
democratically accountable to you.

347
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,769
It will remove some of the urgency.

348
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:46,011
Right. What do you want me to say?

349
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:48,169
Well, I thought...

350
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,932
...it might go something like this.

351
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,493
Oh, Humphrey...

352
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,251
...you're a great loss to the militant revolution.

353
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,929
And you, my dear Agnes...

354
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:10,816
...are a great loss to the Civil Service.

355
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:22,530
- Why does Humphrey want me to see Marriott?
- He must have an ulterior motive.

356
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:26,247
- Why?
- All Humphrey's motives are ulterior.

357
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:30,411
Has he, Bernard? What does Humphrey
really think about this plan?

358
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:32,773
Well, er... Well, I think...

359
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:35,930
That is, I'm sure, if it's what you want...

360
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,692
- I'm sure Sir Humphrey would...
- (DOOR OPENS)

361
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,736
- He would... er...
- As bad as that?

362
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:46,486
- Professor Marriott is outside. Will you see him?
- Yes, of course.

363
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:52,369
- Bernard, I wonder if you'd be kind enough.
- What's your view of the Marriott plan?

364
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:56,531
It is a brilliant way of bringing real democracy
into the government of Britain.

365
00:25:56,698 --> 00:26:00,293
- So you're in favour?
- That's not what he said.

366
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:06,055
If you want real democratic government,
you will have my unquestioning support.

367
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,097
Professor Marriott.

368
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:12,648
Professor, come in. Good of you to come.
Do sit down.

369
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:16,015
- What an honour to meet you.
- Yes, I know.

370
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:23,410
Professor Marriott has a sequel to his original
article that's due to be published next month.

371
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:26,775
It is even more exciting than the first one.

372
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:31,773
- Tell me more, Professor.
- Tell the PM about the benefits to Parliament.

373
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:35,533
Well, as you know,
under my local government scheme,

374
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:39,976
each borough would have
its 500 street representatives.

375
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:44,654
This means the local MP
would be able to talk to them all in one hall.

376
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,615
They'd get to know him.

377
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:51,215
And tell all the people in their street about him.
Word-of-mouth recommendation.

378
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:56,054
- Sounds terrific.
- Where would the constituency party come in?

379
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:58,209
Ah, that's the marvellous thing.

380
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:01,848
Party organisations
would be completely bypassed.

381
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:05,727
- MPs would become genuinely independent.
- What?

382
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:10,892
If they were known to all their constituents
or their committee representatives,

383
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:16,007
then getting re-elected would be nothing to do
with whether the party backed them or not

384
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:19,727
but on whether the constituents
felt they were doing a good job.

385
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:22,890
If the MP wasn't dependent on his party machine,

386
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,209
he could vote against his own party
and get away with it.

387
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,369
There'd be no official candidates.

388
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:34,135
Election would depend on an MP's reputation,
not the image of the party leader.

389
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:38,086
An end of the party machine.
An end to the power of the whips.

390
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:43,651
How would the government gets its unpopular
legislation through without twisting the odd arm?

391
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:46,412
- How would it command a majority?
- It couldn't.

392
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:51,777
There could only be legislation if a majority
of the MPs were actually in favour of it.

393
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,611
Parliament would become genuinely democratic.

394
00:27:54,778 --> 00:28:00,614
Prime Minister, it is the most courageous policy
you have ever proposed.

395
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:06,055
Professor, thank you so much.
Fascinating. Goodbye.

396
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,967
Thank you, Prime Minister.

397
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:13,572
Prime Minister, it's a splendid idea.

398
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,775
- Real democracy.
- It's out of the question.

399
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:20,931
The Marriott scheme was our way
of controlling the local authority.

400
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:26,297
- What will we do about Agnes Moorhouse?
- I've had another word with her.

401
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:31,248
To put it simply, Prime Minister,
certain informal discussions took place

402
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:37,015
involving a full and frank exchange of views,
out of which there arose a series of proposals

403
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:40,887
which proved to indicate
certain promising lines of inquiry,

404
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:45,848
which, when pursued, led to the realisation
that the alternative courses of action

405
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:50,614
might, in fact, in certain circumstances,
be susceptible of discreet modification,

406
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,770
leading to a reappraisal of the areas of difference

407
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:58,728
and pointing the way to encouraging possibilities
of compromise and cooperation

408
00:28:58,898 --> 00:29:03,096
which, if bilaterally implemented
with appropriate give and take on both sides,

409
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:07,251
might, if the climate were right,
have a possibility, at the end of the day,

410
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:11,809
of leading, rightly or wrongly,
to a mutually satisfactory resolution.

411
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,846
What the hell are you talking about?

412
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,209
We did a deal.

413
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:28,328
Oddly enough, she didn't seem to like the idea
of democracy any more than you.

414
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:31,331
- Or you.
- Quite so, dear lady.

415
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:37,209
Well, I think we're all agreed that the nation
isn't quite ready for total democracy.

416
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,494
Perhaps... er... next century?

417
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:44,606
Well, you could still be Prime Minister
next century.

418
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:48,456
- Well, the one after that.
- Yes, Prime Minister.
