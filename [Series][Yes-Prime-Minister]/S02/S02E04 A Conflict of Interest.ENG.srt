1
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,425
Good morning, Prime Minister.

2
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,264
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Mm.

3
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,421
Is it the newspapers?

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,181
Yes. They all say that since my administration
came into office, nothing has changed.

5
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,585
You must be very proud.

6
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,099
That's not meant as a compliment.

7
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,902
I read all ten of this morning's London papers.
Not a good word about me in nine of them.

8
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,541
- But the tenth is better?
- Worse. It doesn't mention me at all.

9
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,988
- What have they got against you?
- They all say the same thing.

10
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,141
That I'm a windbag.

11
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,870
- Good heavens!
- Yeah.

12
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,625
Extraordinary.
They say that my administration's all rhetoric.

13
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,181
That I talk and talk, but nothing ever gets done.
It simply isn't true.

14
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,945
There are reforms in the pipeline,
a change of direction.

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,944
New schemes of development,
a new philosophy of government.

16
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,547
Profound change in the social fabric
and geopolitical climate of this country.

17
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,064
So what is actually happening?

18
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,300
- Nothing yet, obviously.
- (BUZZER)

19
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,906
- That'll be Sir Humphrey.
- Better send him in.

20
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,061
Send Sir Humphrey in.

21
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,223
The origin of this criticism is this rumour
about a scandal in the City.

22
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,109
- How did you guess?
- Prime Minister.

23
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,264
Humphrey, I've decided to respond
to all this criticism about a scandal in the City.

24
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,739
The press is demanding action.

25
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,540
- What are you proposing to do?
- I shall... appoint... someone.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,305
- When did you take this decision?
- Today when I read the papers.

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,621
- But when did you first think of it?
- Today.

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,306
And for how long did you weigh
the pros and cons of this decision?

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,859
Not long. I decided to be decisive.

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,227
I think you worry too much
about what the papers say.

31
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,109
Only a civil servant could make that remark.

32
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,979
I have to worry about them,
with the party conference coming up.

33
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,144
- These rumours of a scandal won't go away.
- Let's not worry until it's more than a rumour.

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,859
- Here's the Cabinet agenda.
- Not now. This is more important.

35
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,344
With respect, it is not. Remember, the press
just pander to their readers' prejudices.

36
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,707
Don't tell me about the press.
I know who reads the papers.

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,067
The "Mirror" is read by people
who think they run the country.

38
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,939
The "Guardian" is read by people
who think they OUGHT to run it.

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,500
The "Times" is read by the people
who DO run the country.

40
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,345
The "Daily Mail" is read by the wives
of the people who run it.

41
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,503
The "Financial Times" is read by people
who OWN the country.

42
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,903
The "Morning Star" is read by people who think
the country should be run by another country

43
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,858
and the "Daily Telegraph"
is read by people who think it is.

44
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,628
What about the people who read "The Sun"?

45
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,545
"Sun" readers don't care who runs the country
as long as she's got big tits.

46
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,500
What do you make of
this Phillips Berenson business, Desmond?

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,662
- Not too good.
- Worse than the press are saying?

48
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,789
More than another investment bank
that made the wrong investments?

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,418
'Fraid so. Tip of the iceberg.

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,309
- Tell me more.
- They've broken the rules.

51
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,461
The insider trading regulations?

52
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,019
- No.
- That's one relief.

53
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,502
Of course they've broken those,
but they've broken the basic rule of the City.

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,868
- I didn't know there were any.
- Just the one.

55
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,024
If you're incompetent, you have to be honest.
If you're crooked, you have to be clever.

56
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,388
If you're honest and make
a pig's breakfast of things, chaps help you out.

57
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,543
- If you're crooked?
- With good profits, chaps don't ask questions.

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,429
They're not stupid. Well, not that stupid.

59
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,343
The ideal is a firm which is honest and clever?

60
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,628
Yes. Let me know if you ever come across one,
won't you?

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,782
- And Phillips Berenson?
- Well, they were...

62
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,147
- Breaking the law.
- I wouldn't put it like that.

63
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,303
Were the directors siphoning off funds
into their own companies?

64
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,859
- Might've paid it back later.
- But didn't.

65
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,102
- Well, they haven't yet.
- Tax fiddles.

66
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,580
They placed their own interpretation
on Treasury regulations.

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,266
- Someone has to interpret them.
- What about the Treasury's interpretation?

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,301
It didn't seem appropriate.

69
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,627
- Capital transfers to Liechtenstein companies?
- Bit of that.

70
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,942
- Bribery?
- Undisclosed commissions to foreign officials.

71
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,180
- Bribery.
- Yes.

72
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,861
- Your brandies.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,419
- May I have the bill?
- Certainly, sir.

74
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,498
So when's all this going to come out?
- That's just it, it mustn't.

75
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,379
- How do you stop it?
- That's what I meant about breaking the rules.

76
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,542
If they were profitable,
it wouldn't need to come out.

77
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,101
- Now they're going bust, I'm worried.
- Are you involved?

78
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,348
Surely a huge bank like yours isn't affected?

79
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,425
I wish you were right, but we've supported
them in a big way. We're in for 400 million.

80
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,583
It's all very well for you,
but when you've got all that Arab mon...

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,742
When you've got all that Arab money at 11%,

82
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,903
you'd look pretty silly
if you didn't lend it to somebody for 14.

83
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,586
- You couldn't trust many people to pay 14.
- Obviously.

84
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,218
Then we put in more to keep them afloat.

85
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,779
- If you knew they were crooks...
- We didn't.

86
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,341
- You could've made inquiries.
- You don't make such inquiries in the City.

87
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,705
They seemed like decent chaps.

88
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,420
Decent chaps don't check up on decent chaps
to see if they're behaving like decent chaps.

89
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,866
And ignorance is worth paying ?00 million for?

90
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,627
Ignorance is safety. It's not a crime
to be deceived. And it's not our own money.

91
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,542
- Your bill, sir.
- Thank you.

92
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,826
So what's going to happen?

93
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,983
Only one answer. The Bank of England
must bail out Phillips Berenson.

94
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,587
- No publicity. That way we get our money back.
- At the taxpayers' expense.

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,741
- Of course.
- Can it be done?

96
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,142
- Depends on the new Bank of England Governor.
- Hasn't been appointed yet.

97
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,268
That's what I wanted to talk about.
Who will it be?

98
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,743
It isn't decided, but I understand from the PM
that the frontrunner is Alexander Jameson.

99
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,184
You're joking? But that's impossible.

100
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,541
- You mean he's too honest.
- It's not just that he behaves honestly.

101
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,103
That doesn't matter.
Some of my best friends behave honestly.

102
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,142
None are smart enough to get away with it.

103
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,304
Jameson actually tries to stop dishonesty.
Fatal. The world doesn't work like that.

104
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,464
Yes, he did that appalling report on waste
and inefficiency in the Civil Service.

105
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,941
- You've got to block him.
- It's difficult. It's a Treasury recommendation.

106
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,419
- But the PM makes the appointment.
- Yes.

107
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,309
It's not just Phillips Berenson.

108
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,463
Once Jameson starts his detective work,
other things will come out.

109
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,066
Collapse of confidence,
the pound will go through the floor.

110
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,427
- Yes, I see.
- You must make the PM see it.

111
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,983
Confidence mustn't be eroded. The City
earns the country six billion pounds a year.

112
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,305
You can't hazard that just because a few chaps
do a few favours for friends. Wouldn't be right.

113
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,268
Well...

114
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,028
Oh, Dorothy, I'm not happy about my speech
for the conference. It contains no good news.

115
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,820
- We couldn't think of any.
- We'll have to make the bad news look good.

116
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,379
I'll talk about the Health Service.

117
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,907
Care for the elderly, mothers and children,
growing up into a healthy nation.

118
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,265
Value for money?

119
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,220
I can't say that. Everybody knows
that costs are completely out of control.

120
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,381
Right.

121
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,989
We are spending more than ever to make
our health service the best in the world.

122
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,460
Good. Now, defence.

123
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,624
I'd hoped to say something about defence cuts,
but I haven't persuaded them to make any yet.

124
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,783
This government will not put the security
of the nation in jeopardy

125
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,942
by penny-pinching and... false economies?

126
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,422
Not that we'd put security in jeopardy
by having ONE service music school

127
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,185
instead of three separate ones
for the Army, Navy and RAF.

128
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,344
There can hardly be a specifically
Royal Naval method of playing bassoon.

129
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,149
You won't put that in? No, sorry.

130
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,098
- Anything good we can say about the economy?
- That's a problem. No good news at all.

131
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,219
- We'll find something.
- No bad news will break during the conference?

132
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,464
Don't ask me! I'm only the political adviser.
YOU see the secret Treasury papers.

133
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,420
I was thinking about this Phillips Berenson
scandal. What do you make of it?

134
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,785
- I'm suspicious.
- Why?

135
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,819
Because of the statements of the chairman
of the Stock Exchange and chairman of Lloyds.

136
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,141
- There were no statements.
- That's why I'm suspicious.

137
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,508
If there was nothing in these rumours,
they'd fall over themselves to say so.

138
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,666
So unfair. Scandals in the City always look bad
for the government. It's nothing to do with me.

139
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,903
I know! I could announce
the new Governor of the Bank of England.

140
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,463
Bernard, see if you can see Humphrey around.
Tell him I'd like to see him. Where were we?

141
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,622
- The economy. Unemployment coming down?
- No.

142
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,578
We shall make the attack on unemployment
our top priority. Pay?

143
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,585
- Rising too fast.
- We cannot pay ourselves more than we earn.

144
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,789
The world does not owe us a living.
Interest rates?

145
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,418
- Too high.
- They might come down?

146
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,548
- That'd be terrific.
- I don't have that kind of luck.

147
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,182
If the whole picture's a total disaster,
we can always wave the Union Jack.

148
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,423
- The nation's great destiny...
- Unique role on the world stage.

149
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,539
Make every effort to build a prosperous world
for our children and our children's children.

150
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,100
That's probably about how long it'll take.

151
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,542
The PM wonders
if you could join him in five minutes.

152
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,099
Certainly, Bernard. Bernard...

153
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,058
Any news about the governorship
of the Bank of England?

154
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,020
The Prime Minister is planning
to appoint Alexander Jameson. Mr Clean.

155
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,068
- That's one bit of good news.
- Appalling news!

156
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,702
- Will you try and change the PM's mind?
- No.

157
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,225
I WILL change the PM's mind.

158
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,383
- He seems very keen on him.
- That'll be my starting point.

159
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,623
When you wish to suggest
that somebody is not the ideal choice...

160
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,341
- You rubbish them?
- The first stage is to express absolute support.

161
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,707
- Why?
- You don't want to say somebody's no good.

162
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,065
You must be seen to be their friend.

163
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,907
After all, it is necessary to get behind someone
before you can stab them in the back.

164
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,698
But Alexander Jameson is good.
He's honest and efficient.

165
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,338
Excellent. That's the second stage.

166
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,901
You list his praiseworthy qualities,
especially those that make him unsuitable.

167
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,268
You praise them to the point
where they become a vice. The third stage.

168
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,902
Or, better still, you over-simplify his views
by labelling them, as you just did.

169
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,267
- You mean Mr Clean?
- Yes.

170
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,220
But I think we can do better than that.
Do sit down, Bernard.

171
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,588
- Isn't he a churchgoer?
- Yes, I believe he was once a lay preacher.

172
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,140
- A long time ago.
- Splendid. We can use that against him.

173
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:32,304
- How?
- Charming man, hasn't an enemy in the world.

174
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,668
But is he really up to dealing with
some of those rogues in the City?

175
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,539
- Jameson's pretty tough.
- Then we'll say he's too tough.

176
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,500
The fourth stage. You name all his bad points
by defending and excusing them.

177
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,061
You know - "Oh, it probably doesn't matter
that he was a conscientious objector.

178
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,621
"I'm sure... nobody's really questioned
his patriotism."

179
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,500
Or "I think the criticisms of him
for bankrupting his last company

180
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,184
"weren't entirely fair."

181
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,549
- That would certainly do it.
- If not, you can always hint at a hidden scandal.

182
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,508
If he's not married, hint at homosexuality.

183
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,428
- If he is married?
- Adultery.

184
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,788
With a lady's who's beyond reproach.
One of the royals, for instance.

185
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,300
Or a television newsreader.

186
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,379
What if he's obviously happily married?

187
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,544
Say he's extremely puritanical or he drinks
or he's having psychiatric treatment.

188
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,861
The possibilities are endless. Listen and learn.

189
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,021
Yeah...

190
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,181
Er, Sir Humphrey...

191
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,983
- Prime Minister.
- We've been working on my conference speech.

192
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,348
- I'm worried about this scandal in the City.
- I don't think it's very serious.

193
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,707
- It certainly is.
- No, no, no, dear lady.

194
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,582
The bank over-lent to one big borrower, that's all.

195
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,425
Some of its directors have a shady past.
There's more to it.

196
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,184
- Can you prove it?
- No, it's my antennae.

197
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,341
(LAUGHS CONDESCENDINGLY)

198
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,220
I think, Prime Minister, that we are
in the realm of female intuition.

199
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,298
- We'll see.
- We shall indeed.

200
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,063
Anyway, the good news is I've decided to appoint
Jameson as Governor of the Bank of England.

201
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,381
Oh, the lay preacher! What a nice chap!

202
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,745
- Why do you call him that?
- He is.

203
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,344
Is he? That's good, isn't it?

204
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,980
Oh... good is exactly the word.

205
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,941
He's a really good man. Did a really good job
at the White Fish Authority, too, didn't he?

206
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,386
- Where does he preach?
- In church, I imagine.

207
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,340
He's frightfully religious and terribly honest.
Honest with absolutely everybody.

208
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,503
- Is he? That is good.
- Of course it's good. On the whole.

209
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,501
If he finds a scandal anywhere -

210
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,027
even here in No.10 -
he'll tell everybody, no doubt about that.

211
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,263
- You mean he's indiscreet?
- Oh, dear, that's such a pejorative word.

212
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:16,027
- I'd prefer to say he's obsessively honest.
- He's the right man to bring the City into line?

213
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,784
Oh, absolu... If you want a saint.

214
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,018
Of course, there are those who say
he doesn't live in the real world.

215
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,785
He is extremely puritanical,
even for a Bible basher.

216
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,102
- Is he?
- Oh, yes. A bit of an ayatollah, in fact.

217
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,468
Do you want to risk a Samson who might
bring the whole edifice crashing down?

218
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,623
- Yeah, that's a worry, isn't it?
- He's no respecter of persons.

219
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,988
Although treading on toes is sometimes
a necessity, he makes it a hobby.

220
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,143
He likes everything out in the open.
He talks very freely to the press.

221
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,942
- In fact, he's not... awfully realistic.
- Do you know anything else about him?

222
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,104
Well, one wonders if anybody can be that moral.

223
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,740
- I've heard...
- Yes?

224
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,422
No.

225
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,022
No, nothing. I'm sure it won't come out.

226
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,987
What?

227
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,581
No, nothing.

228
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,981
I'm sure it's nothing.

229
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,628
- Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, sir.
- My dear chap.

230
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,781
- Humphrey.
- Sit down.

231
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,387
Thanks. What's this rumour I hear
that you're rubbishing Jameson?

232
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,943
- The lay preacher? I think he's a splendid chap.
- No. Don't play that game with me, Humphrey.

233
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,183
- The Treasury wants him to be the new Governor.
- Why?

234
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,381
It's time the Governor of the Bank of England
was intelligent and competent.

235
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,101
It'd be an innovation.

236
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,058
- Don't you think it should be tried?
- But it's so dangerous.

237
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,427
Look, we keep enduring these City scandals.

238
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,868
The Chancellor is fed up
with having to defend the indefensible.

239
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,498
Look, Frank, I understand.

240
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,106
You're looking after the Chancellor's interests.
That's your job.

241
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,264
I'm looking after the Prime Minister's interests
and the nation's. That's mine.

242
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,662
An honest financial sector
can't damage the national interest.

243
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,821
In the long term, it's a plus.

244
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,984
Unfortunately, in the short term, an inquiry
into the City would mean a loss of confidence.

245
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,541
The pound would plunge, shares would plunge
and the government would plunge.

246
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,747
Ah, well, I'm afraid that's YP.

247
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,589
YP?

248
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,301
Your problem.

249
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,907
Actually, Frank... I'm not so sure.

250
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,460
As you know, about 60%
of Phillips Berenson's outstanding loans

251
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,349
are with three foreigners of dubious repute.

252
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,822
The Bank of England is responsible
for supervising Phillips Berenson.

253
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,063
- That's been a farce.
- Their investigators are a bunch of amateurs.

254
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,825
But who's responsible for supervising
the Bank of England?

255
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,705
- The Treasury, isn't it?
- Well, yes...

256
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,466
How can I tell the Chancellor that if we have
a clean-up, he may be held responsible?

257
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,466
He'd be defending the really indefensible then.
He'd need an awful lot of support from the PM.

258
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,586
Yes, but he'd get it, presumably.

259
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,540
The PM isn't keen on defending the indefensible.
He'd need a lot of convincing.

260
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,819
The Chancellor would have to tell him that he'd
been let down by his Treasury officials, Frank.

261
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,661
But... But... But...

262
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,308
YP?

263
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,829
You're absolutely right, this is frightful.

264
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,345
What's the difference between irregularities
and malpractices?

265
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,863
Irregularity means it's a crime you can't prove.
Malpractice means it's a crime you can prove.

266
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,906
- Anyone else seen this?
- Nobody.

267
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,540
How did we get this secret auditor's report
on Phillips Berenson?

268
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,498
- A partner at the accountant's is a friend.
- Just friendship?

269
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,265
He's looking forward to reading
the New Year's Honours List.

270
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,546
All right. How do we do it? Which section?

271
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,544
What about through the Welsh Office
for services to LEEKS!

272
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,500
It surprises me that Bartlett's Bank should be
so deeply involved. Doesn't it surprise you?

273
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,824
- Not with Sir Desmond Glazebrook as chairman.
- How on earth did he become chairman?

274
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,699
He never has any original ideas,
never takes a stand on principle.

275
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,581
As he doesn't understand anything, he agrees
with everybody and so people think he's sound.

276
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,584
Is that why I've been invited to consult him
about this governorship?

277
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,741
He's due in a few minutes.

278
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,347
You may find he doesn't want you
to appoint Jameson to do a clean-up.

279
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,899
- No option after this.
- Not if it gets out.

280
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,630
- Some of it's bound to.
- If it gets to court.

281
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,100
A Bank of England rescue
will keep the worst of it quiet.

282
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,183
- (BUZZER)
- Who will Glazebrook want me to appoint?

283
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,979
- Desmond Glazebrook.
- Absolutely right, Bernard.

284
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,781
- What about?
- You're not serious?

285
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,784
Who has the most interest in a cover-up?
Sir Desmond Glazebrook.

286
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,862
- Ask him in.
- Sir Humphrey's with him. Send them in.

287
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,342
- They'll know about this?
- Yes, but they mustn't know that you know.

288
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,978
Or you'll have to make the partner an earl.

289
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,138
- Ah, Sir Desmond, how good of you to come.
- Prime Minister.

290
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,904
Do sit down, won't you?

291
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:56,782
Now, as you know... I've got to appoint
a new Governor for the Bank of England.

292
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,341
- I'd welcome your views.
- Well, I certainly think you should appoint one.

293
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,669
I think the Prime Minister's
more or less decided that.

294
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,822
- The question is whom.
- Ah, that's tricky.

295
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,299
Needs to be someone the chaps trust.

296
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,349
I feel we need someone who's intelligent,
energetic, upright.

297
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,980
- Er, well, hold on.
- You don't agree?

298
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,746
Well, of course, it's a jolly interesting idea,
Prime Minister.

299
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,708
Not sure the chaps would trust that sort of chap.

300
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,786
The PM is worried about financial scandals.
Are you worried about financial scandals?

301
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,547
Of course, we don't want any of those, but...
if you go for the sort of chap the chaps trust,

302
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,342
you can trust him to be the sort of chap to see
the chaps don't get involved in any scandals.

303
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,899
- He'd hush them up.
- No, any suspicion,

304
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,062
and you have the chap straight out for lunch.

305
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,180
- Ask him if there's anything in it.
- What if he says no?

306
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,540
You have to trust a chap's word.
That's how the City works.

307
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,501
- What do you know about Phillips Berenson?
- What do YOU know about Phillips Berenson?

308
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,742
Well, er, only what I read in the papers.

309
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,628
Oh, good.

310
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,505
Yes, well, they lent a bit of money
to the wrong chaps. Could happen to anyone.

311
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,582
- You haven't heard rumours?
- There are always rumours.

312
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,266
Of bribery? Embezzlement?
Misappropriation? Insider dealing?

313
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,866
- Dear lady, those are strong words.
- So they're not true?

314
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,827
Well, er, there are different... er...
different ways of looking at things.

315
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,425
What's a different way
of looking at embezzlement?

316
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,343
If a chap embezzles, you have to do something.

317
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,900
- Have a serious word with him?
- Absolutely.

318
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,665
Usually it's just a chap
who's advanced himself a short-term,

319
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,823
unauthorised, unsecured temporary loan
from the company's account

320
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,026
and invested it unluckily.

321
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,901
Horse falls at the first fence, that sort of thing.

322
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,383
- So who do you think I should appoint?
- Oh, well, as I say, that's not easy.

323
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,701
Not all that many chaps the chaps trust.

324
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,863
It's not for me to say,
but if one were to be asked...

325
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,342
As long as one were thought to be...
Of course, one is committed, but...

326
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,106
And if one were to be pressed,
I daresay one could make oneself available.

327
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,745
As a duty one owes to...

328
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,107
- I was thinking of Alexander Jameson.
- Ah.

329
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,580
- What's your view?
- Well, he's a good accountant.

330
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,342
- Honest?
- Yes.

331
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,899
- Energetic?
- I'm afraid so.

332
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,459
- But would you recommend him?
- No.

333
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,942
- Why not?
- Well, the City's a funny place, Prime Minister.

334
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,819
If you spill the beans,
you open up a whole can of worms.

335
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,703
How can you let sleeping dogs lie
if you let the cat out of the bag?

336
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,469
Bring in a new broom and, if you're not careful,
you've thrown the baby out with the bath water.

337
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,228
If you change horses in the middle of the stream,

338
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,427
then you're up the creek without a paddle.

339
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,423
And then the balloon goes up!

340
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,459
Obviously. They hit you for six.

341
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,947
An own goal, in fact.

342
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,742
I'm on in half an hour
and this speech is devoid of content.

343
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,107
- Oh, I don't know.
- What do you think, Bernard?

344
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,989
- I don't know.
- Well, I do know.

345
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,109
- It'll get a standing ovation.
- Oh. How long?

346
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,261
- Three and a half minutes.
- (PHONE)

347
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,581
- Have people got stopwatches (?)
- Issued them today.

348
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,186
Sir Humphrey's downstairs with the Burandan
High Commissioner. Could they have a word?

349
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,944
- Burandan High...?
- He says it's urgent.

350
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,739
Oh, all right. He'd better be quick.

351
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,506
- Can't we talk about getting more investment?
- Interest rates are too high.

352
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,460
Can't you lean on the Chancellor to lean on
the Bank of England to lean on the banks?

353
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,225
What, in half an hour? Not in a month of Sundays!

354
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:13,180
The Bank would never allow it.
All I can do is appoint Mr Clean as Governor.

355
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,740
"Hacker will take no more nonsense
from the City."

356
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,859
- Prime Minister.
- High Commissioner, an unexpected pleasure!

357
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,498
Do come in. Sit down, please.

358
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,865
Now, what can I do for you?

359
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,818
Well, the High Commissioner's
concerned about the rumour

360
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,380
that you intend to appoint Jameson
to the Bank of England,

361
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,543
which will inevitably create an investigation
into Phillips Berenson.

362
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,262
Forgive me, but how does this concern Buranda?

363
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,139
Phillips Berenson is a shady bank
that lent 60% of its money

364
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,870
to three foreigners of doubtful repute.

365
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,023
Two of those three foreigners
were the President of Buranda

366
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,978
and the Chairman
of the Burandan Enterprise Corporation.

367
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,023
If you attack these loans,
the President of Buranda will have no option

368
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,660
but to interpret this move
as a hostile and racist act.

369
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,786
- Racist?
- Of course.

370
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,466
I've no intention of attacking the President
per se. L-I would merely...

371
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,658
- Say that he was someone of dubious repute.
- Yes. No, no, no.

372
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,468
I... I...

373
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,225
May I further point out that a racist attack
on our President

374
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,544
would undoubtedly create solidarity and support
from all the other African states.

375
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,666
Commonwealth countries.

376
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,142
We would move to have Britain
expelled from the Commonwealth.

377
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,701
The President would be obliged to cancel
Her Majesty's state visit next month

378
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,068
and Buranda would sell all the British
government stock that it has bought.

379
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,700
- Would that create a run on the pound?
- Yes.

380
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,862
- Anything else?
- Isn't that enough?

381
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,229
High Commissioner, will you excuse me
if I have a few words with Sir Humphrey?

382
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,225
Thank you so much. So good of you to come
and... such a long way.

383
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,178
- I'll give your words earnest consideration.
- Please do.

384
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,818
- How dare you put me in this position!
- It is not I, but Buranda.

385
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,699
The Commonwealth club is another reason
you should exercise caution.

386
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,861
The President is a crook!

387
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,579
He shouldn't be a member of the club.
He should be blackballed.

388
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,742
- He is already.
- Yes, thank you, Bernard.

389
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,303
I don't understand it, Humphrey.
What's your game?

390
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,463
Why should I allow another cover-up?
What's in it for you?

391
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,226
Nothing, Prime Minister! I assure you,
I have no private ulterior motive.

392
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,145
I'm trying to protect you from yourself.
I'm entirely on your side.

393
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,667
- How can we believe that?
- Because this time it's true!

394
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,380
I mean, this time I am particularly on your side.

395
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,144
I've got to say something good
in my speech today.

396
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,780
If I can't announce the appointment of Mr Clean
as Governor...

397
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,580
- Why not announce a cut in interest rates?
- Oh, don't be silly, I... What?

398
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,900
Announce a cut in interest rates

399
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,904
The Bank couldn't allow a political cut -
particularly with Jameson.

400
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,265
It would with Desmond Glazebrook.

401
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,625
Now, if you appoint him Governor,

402
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,342
he'll cut Bartlett's interest rates in the morning -
you can announce both in your speech.

403
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,741
- How do you know?
- He's just told me. He's here.

404
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,943
Desmond Glazebrook as Governor?
But he's such a fool.

405
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,900
He only talks in clich閟. He can talk
in clich閟 till the cows come home.

406
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,501
Won't a cut in interest rates
mean that prices will go up?

407
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,027
I don't mind that,
as long as I get a standing inflation... ovation.

408
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,628
- You don't want an honest man in the City?
- Glazebrook isn't exactly... dishonest, is he?

409
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,260
No, he's too stupid to know
whether he's honest or not.

410
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,467
We can't operate without the City's goodwill,
can we?

411
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,021
- No, Prime Minister.
- No point in embarrassing them needlessly.

412
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,420
No, Prime Minister.

413
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,744
Dorothy, fix my speech to include
a cut in interest rates.

414
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,428
Humphrey, ask Sir Desmond to come up here.

415
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,785
Yes, Prime Minister.
