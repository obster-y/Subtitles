1
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:46,111
- The Chief Whip and Party Chairman to see you.
- Take a seat. I'll be right with you.

2
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:49,876
Bernard, take a seat.
I want you here for this meeting.

3
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,750
- Isn't this a party matter?
- It's also a government matter.

4
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,516
- It's about our education policy.
- The government's or party's?

5
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:01,469
- It's the same thing.
- With respect, they're not the same thing.

6
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,030
- That's why we want the meeting.
- It seems...

7
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,476
Bernard... sit!

8
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,353
Stay.

9
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,998
What's the problem?

10
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,595
- Education.
- What can I do about it?

11
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,958
- You're the Prime Minister.
- Yes, I know.

12
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,840
I have no direct control over education.

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,359
I don't control the curriculum or exams. I don't
control the choice of head teachers. Nothing.

14
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:34,480
The voters hold you responsible for everything.
You do have influence.

15
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:40,637
I'm fed up with it. When I became PM, I thought
I'd have power. And what have I got? Influence.

16
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,599
I've got no power over the police, the rates,

17
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:48,915
EEC directives, European courts, our courts,
the judges, NATO.

18
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,790
- What have I got the power to do?
- Lose us the next election.

19
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,794
Which you will if you don't tackle education.

20
00:01:55,961 --> 00:02:00,557
The voters want something done
about low academic attainment.

21
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,440
- Sex education!
- I'm not against sex education.

22
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:09,437
I'm not against children being taught the facts
of life in class, but not homosexual technique!

23
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:13,799
- Or heterosexual technique, come to that.
- Where should they learn it?

24
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:16,429
Behind the bike sheds like we did!

25
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,477
Did you?

26
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,152
Never mind sexual technique.

27
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,518
Some of our schools are teaching
more Hindi than English.

28
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:30,152
I know English is more important,
but I daren't say so or I'd be accused of racism.

29
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:34,519
When I met the Ethnic Awareness Council,
I happened to glance at my watch

30
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:39,516
when a black woman delegate was speaking
and I was accused of racist body language.

31
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,273
And sexist.

32
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:45,639
- I get the message. What do you want me to do?
- Get a grip on education.

33
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,998
Get Henry to do something
about the Department of Education.

34
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,595
- They've got him house-trained.
- Sack him.

35
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:54,229
I can't have another Cabinet convulsion.

36
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,916
- Then invite the opposition leader's wife here.
- What can she do?

37
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,073
Start measuring up for carpets and curtains.

38
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:07,073
Yes, right, fine. This afternoon?

39
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,200
- Bernard, I believe the PM wants to see me.
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.

40
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:14,558
- What's his problem?
- Education.

41
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:18,316
Well, it's a bit late to do anything about that now.

42
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:21,473
- No, no, the education system.
- I see.

43
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,078
- Bit late to do anything about that either.
- He thinks he'll lose the next election.

44
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:30,519
- Worse things could befall the nation.
- He can't ignore facts.

45
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:34,674
If he can't ignore facts,
he's got no business being a politician.

46
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,998
Anyway, Bernard, he's got nothing to worry about.

47
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:42,756
The education system does all
most parents require of it.

48
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,640
Keeps children out of mischief
while they're at work.

49
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:51,080
That paper the Party Chairman had suggests
the comprehensive system is breaking down.

50
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:57,635
Bernard, I never thought to hear such language
from a loyal member of the Civil Service!

51
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:01,953
- Have you been got at by the enemy?
- You mean the Russians?

52
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:08,551
No, Bernard, I mean the Prime Minister's
political advisor - that Wainwright female.

53
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:13,875
- Comprehensive education ought to be validated.
- Of course, but not invalidated.

54
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,919
But if it was introduced to improve standards...

55
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,278
Whatever gave you that idea?

56
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:25,075
- You mean it was to get rid of class distinction?
- Precisely!

57
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,436
- So that all children...
- Children?

58
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,798
- Who mentioned children?
- I just...

59
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:34,351
The Department of Education
never mentions children!

60
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:39,470
No, no, no, no, Bernard. It was to get rid of
class distinction in the teaching profession.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,752
Improve the living standard of teachers,
not the educational standards of children.

62
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,913
Bring the NUT teachers up to the salary level

63
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,552
of their rivals in the National Association
of Schoolmasters in the grammar schools.

64
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:56,713
- But the...
- When there is a Labour government,

65
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,874
the Education Department says
comprehensives abolish the class system.

66
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:05,637
When there's a Tory government, they say
it's the cheapest way to provide mass education.

67
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,998
To Labour, we explain
that selective education is divisive

68
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,597
and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.

69
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:19,877
That way, we have a happy relationship with the
NUT and we educate our own children privately.

70
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,590
- But if the government wants change...
- The teaching unions don't.

71
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:29,356
Isn't it our job to persuade unions
to accept government policy?

72
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,673
No, it is our job to get the government
to accept union policy.

73
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:39,632
Since government change policy all the time
and unions never change their policy at all,

74
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:44,272
common sense requires that the government
be brought in line with the unions.

75
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,273
Yes, Prime Minister?
Oh, fine. He can see you now.

76
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:55,520
Sir Humphrey, he's very worried that he seems
responsible for something he can't change.

77
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:58,673
Yes, I'm sure. Responsibility without power -

78
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,958
the prerogative of the eunuch
throughout the ages.

79
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,670
- Prime Minister.
- Good morning. What were you saying?

80
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,754
Nothing. I understand you're worried
about the local education authority.

81
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:16,030
- No, the Department of Education and Science.
- Indeed? I think the DES does a splendid job.

82
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:21,355
Look what's happened to education.
This is a question from a Religious Studies paper.

83
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,479
"Which do you prefer - atom bombs or charity?"

84
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,392
Even maths is politicised.

85
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:32,713
"If it costs ? billion a year to maintain
Britain's nuclear defences

86
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,476
"and ?5 a year to feed a starving African child,

87
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,439
"how many children
could be saved from starvation

88
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:43,150
"if the Ministry of Defence
abandoned nuclear weapons?"

89
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:48,879
That's easy. None. They'd spend it all
on conventional weapons.

90
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,875
In any case, it's just a sum.
Five billion divided by 75.

91
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,555
But children aren't learning to do the sums.

92
00:06:55,721 --> 00:07:01,956
The local education authorities might argue
that they don't need to. They have calculators.

93
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:07,241
They all need to know HOW it's done. We were
all taught basis arithmetic, weren't we?

94
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,394
Were we? What's 3,947 divided by 73?

95
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:16,351
Er... Oh, I'd need a pencil and paper to do that.
No, never mind that.

96
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:23,791
- I could do it when I left school.
- Now you'd use a calculator.

97
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:27,840
That's not the point. Look at Latin.
Hardly anybody knows that now.

98
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,553
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.

99
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,633
What?

100
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,872
- Times change and we change with the times.
- Precisely.

101
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,796
- Si tacuisses, philosophus manisses.
- What does that mean?

102
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,954
If you'd kept your mouth shut,
we might have thought you were clever.

103
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,398
- I beg your pardon?
- Not you, Prime Minister. That's the translation.

104
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,270
No one would have thought
Sir Humphrey was saying that about you.

105
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:00,477
Go away, Bernard, please.

106
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,550
I can't believe it. You had a strict academic
upbringing. Are you denying the value of it?

107
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:12,557
What's the use of it? I can't even call upon it
in conversation with the PM of Great Britain!

108
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,110
Education in this country is a disaster.

109
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:19,638
We're supposed to prepare children for work.
Most of the time they're bored stiff.

110
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:24,636
I should've thought that being bored stiff
was an excellent preparation for work.

111
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:29,909
The school leaving age was raised to 16,
but they're learning less.

112
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,549
We didn't raise it so they'd learn more

113
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,317
but to keep teenagers off the job market
and hold down unemployment figures.

114
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:40,075
Are you saying there's nothing wrong
with education?

115
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:43,711
Of course not.
It's a joke. It's always been a joke.

116
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,874
By leaving it in the hands of local councillors,
it will remain a joke.

117
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,032
Half of them are your enemies

118
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:54,479
and the other half are the sort of friends
that make you prefer your enemies.

119
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:58,475
- What are you saying?
- That education will never get any better

120
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:02,111
as long as it's subject to all that tomfoolery
in the town halls.

121
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,671
Imagine what would happen
if you put defence in their hands.

122
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,401
- Defence?
- Give councils ?00 million each

123
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:13,351
and ask them to defend themselves,
we'd have a civil war in three weeks!

124
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,911
- You're being silly.
- Am I? That's what's happened to education.

125
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:22,632
And why? Because nobody thinks education
is serious the way defence is serious.

126
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,077
So that's why civil defence
is in local authority hands?

127
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:29,039
Of course. Because everybody knows it's a joke.

128
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:34,195
You just don't leave important matters
in the hands of those clowns!

129
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:36,955
And as you've left education to them,

130
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:41,239
one must assume that, until now,
you have attached little importance to it.

131
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,677
It is important.
It could lose me the next election.

132
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,638
Ah!

133
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:52,034
In my naivety, I thought you were concerned
about the future of our children.

134
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,356
Yes, that too. After all, they get the vote at 18.

135
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:02,312
Then, Prime Minister, then centralise.
Take it away from the local councils.

136
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,119
Put it under the Department of Education,
then you could do something about it.

137
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:11,194
Do you think I could? Grasp the nettle,
take the bull by the horns?

138
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,559
You can't take the bull by the horns
if you're grasping the nettle.

139
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,473
Oh, really, Bernard?

140
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:23,554
By grasping the nettle with one hand, you could
take the bull by one horn with the other hand,

141
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:26,713
but not both horns
because your hand isn't big enough.

142
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:31,671
If you did take the bull by one horn,
it would be rather dangerous because...

143
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:39,195
Well, it was just a mixed metaphor
and since we were discussing education, I...

144
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,955
- (BUZZER)
- Thank God!

145
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,237
Yes? Your political advisor's outside.

146
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:49,598
- Send her in, Bernard. Humphrey, thank you.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:54,312
- You've given me much food for thought.
- In that case, Prime Minister, bon app閠it.

148
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,319
Dear lady.

149
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:02,789
- Yes, Dorothy?
- My notes for your tour of the north-west.

150
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,521
Visits to hospitals and factories.

151
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:09,151
- Drumming up votes in marginal constituencies.
- No!

152
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:12,916
- Why not?
- I'm coming with you if it's a government tour.

153
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:17,199
If it's canvassing marginals,
I can't come and the Treasury can't pay.

154
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:22,355
It's a government visit. It's coincidence
that all the stop-offs are in marginals.

155
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,638
- Well, that's all right, then.
- That's OK.

156
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,520
What can I do about education? Quickly.

157
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:32,720
- You mean do or appear to do?
- Appear to do. I can't do, obviously.

158
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:38,672
Well, in the short term, we could get you on TV
associated with something good and successful.

159
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:42,197
- Is there something?
- I had thought of this for your schedule.

160
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:47,151
- You could fit it in.
- St Margaret's School Young Enterprise Scheme.

161
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:52,714
It's set up its own manufacturing company. They
make cheeseboards, paperweights, toast racks,

162
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:56,669
sell them and track the operation
in their business-study classes.

163
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,119
- They involve local businessmen. Parents help.
- Does it cost a lot?

164
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:05,638
- No, it makes a profit.
- Isn't it teaching them to be rather grasping?

165
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:09,999
- No, they give the money to local charity.
- Fine, I'll do it.

166
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:15,758
Make sure the TV crews have plenty of time
to cover me... er... cover the event properly.

167
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:20,711
Write me a speech with a snappy,
20-second piece for the news bulletins.

168
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:23,679
- That should win back a few seats.
- Prime Minister.

169
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:28,551
Er, give a lead to those responsible
for the nation's education, Bernard.

170
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,916
Of course, Prime Minister.

171
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:34,471
<i>(NEWSREADER)</i>
<i>Finally, the PM visited St Margaret's School</i>

172
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,632
<i>on his north-western tour.</i>

173
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,793
<i>The school has set up</i>
<i>a manufacturing business</i>

174
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:44,398
<i>where the children make a variety of goods</i>
<i>for sale in the local community.</i>

175
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:49,681
<i>The children do their own sales and marketing</i>
<i>and use the experience they gain</i>

176
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:53,880
<i>as a basis for their maths and business studies.</i>

177
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,080
<i>The Prime Minister was presented</i>
<i>with an example of the school's output.</i>

178
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,789
In conclusion, I must congratulate you

179
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:06,398
<i>on all the hard work, the discipline</i>
<i>and the success of your enterprise.</i>

180
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:12,033
<i>You've set an example in British education</i>
<i>which other schools would do well to follow.</i>

181
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:18,117
<i>We need more schools like St Margaret's</i>
<i>and I shall always treasure your present.</i>

182
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:22,069
<i>No Prime Minister ever lost a seat</i>
<i>if he could help itl</i>

183
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:28,191
<i>(NEWSREADER) And that was</i>
<i>the six o'clock news from the BBC.</i>

184
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,629
- I thought that was OK, didn't you?
- Fine.

185
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,599
- My joke went down well.
- MY joke!

186
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:42,755
Better than Channel 4 coverage. They didn't
describe it as the PM's tour of the north-west.

187
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:46,709
They said, "Jim Hacker touring
the marginal constituencies."

188
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:50,999
- That's true, isn't it?
- But they shouldn't say it. It's biased reporting!

189
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,710
- Reporting the facts?
- Nothing wrong with visiting the marginals.

190
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,635
- What they said was still true.
- It was still biased to say it!

191
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,794
I'm not interested in your paranoia.
I was interested in that school.

192
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:07,637
- Parents queue up to get their children into it.
- Pity they can't all get in. Coffee?

193
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:11,840
- Lovely.
- Why can't more parents send children there?

194
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,799
- No room.
- There is. School numbers are falling.

195
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,873
- That'd mean poaching the other schools.
- So what?

196
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,350
The other schools would have to close.

197
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,399
Great! St Margaret's could
take over their buildings.

198
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,394
- Darling, that wouldn't be fair.
- Who to?

199
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:32,477
- The teachers in the schools that had to close.
- Good ones could teach at the popular schools.

200
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:36,316
What about the bad teachers?
It wouldn't be fair on them.

201
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:40,520
What about the children,
or are the bad teachers' jobs more important?

202
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:45,471
Darling, it's... it's no good. Who's to say
who are the bad teachers? It just wouldn't work.

203
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,031
- Why not?
- Well... it wouldn't work.

204
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,237
- Why not?
- What do you mean?

205
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:57,351
Suppose schools were like doctors. In the NHS,
you choose which doctor to go to, don't you?

206
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,989
- Yes.
- And he gets paid per patient.

207
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:05,151
Why don't we do the same with schools?
Have a National Education Service.

208
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,200
Parents could choose the schools
and the schools get paid per pupil.

209
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:12,000
- Exactly!
- There'd be an outcry.

210
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,870
- From the parents?
- No, from the Department of Education.

211
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,431
- I see. And who has the most votes?
- The DES would block it.

212
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,195
- Fine, get rid of them.
- What?

213
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:25,956
- Get rid of the Department of Education.
- I don't understand you.

214
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:30,558
Get rid of it, abolish it, remove it, expunge it,

215
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,316
eliminate it, eradicate it, exterminate it!

216
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,871
- Get rid of it!
- Get rid of it?

217
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,396
- Yes.
- I couldn't do that.

218
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,951
- Why not? What does it do?
- I could do that.

219
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,590
Local government could administer the lot.

220
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,959
We could have a Board of School Inspectors.
The rest could go to Environment.

221
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:55,909
I could send that house-trained idiot Henry
to the House of Lords.

222
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,641
Golly. I wonder what Humphrey will say.

223
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,998
Whatever he says,
I want to be there when you tell him.

224
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,234
To witness the clash between the political will
and the administrative will?

225
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:10,872
I think it'll be a clash between the political will
and the administrative won't.

226
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:17,871
- You sent for me, Prime Minister?
- Humphrey, come in. Sit down.

227
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:23,399
I want to bounce an idea off you. I've realised
how to reform the educational system.

228
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,790
Excellent, Prime Minister. (CLAPS HIS HANDS)

229
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:32,398
I'm going to let parents move their children
to any school they want.

230
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:38,031
You mean after application, scrutiny,
tribunal hearing and appeals procedures?

231
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:42,991
- No, just move them whenever they want to.
- I'm sorry. I don't quite follow.

232
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:47,951
This government will let parents decide
which schools to send their children to.

233
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:50,919
Prime Minister, you can't be serious!

234
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,470
- I am.
- But it's preposterous!

235
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:57,111
- Why?
- You can't expect parents to make these choices.

236
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:01,240
How on earth would parents know
which schools are best?

237
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,599
- Which school did you go to, Humphrey?
- Winchester.

238
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,594
- Was it good?
- Oh, excellent, of course.

239
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,151
- Who chose it?
- My parents, naturally.

240
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:18,991
Now, that's different, Prime Minister.
My parents were discerning people.

241
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,995
You can't expect ordinary people
to know where to send their children.

242
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,312
- Why not?
- Well, how could they tell?

243
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:30,076
They could tell if their kids
could read, write and do sums

244
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,391
and if the exam results were good.

245
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,597
- Exam results aren't everything.
- True.

246
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:39,551
Parents who don't want an academic education
for their children can pick progressive schools.

247
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:43,919
But parents have no qualifications
to make these choices.

248
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:49,474
Teachers are the professionals. Parents
are the worst people to bring up children.

249
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:55,680
They've no qualifications, no training.
You don't expect untrained teachers to teach.

250
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,911
The same should apply to parents.

251
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:02,279
- Before having children, they should be trained?
- No, that's no problem.

252
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,239
They've all been trained to HAVE kids.

253
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,598
Sex-education classes have been standard
for some years.

254
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,752
Perhaps we could do better.

255
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:15,711
Before people can have children, we should
make them sit exams - written and practical.

256
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:20,352
Perhaps both. Then they could be issued
with breeding licences.

257
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,871
Oh, very droll, Prime Minister.

258
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:30,876
No, but I'm being serious. It's looking after
children that parents are not qualified for.

259
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:35,193
That's why they have no idea
which schools to choose. It couldn't work.

260
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:40,230
What about the Health Service? People choose
their doctor without medical qualifications.

261
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,596
- Ah, yes, well, that's different.
- How?

262
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:47,357
Well, doctors are...
The patients aren't parents, dear lady.

263
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:50,831
Oh, really? What makes you think that, Humpy?

264
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,073
Not as such. In any case, as a matter of fact,

265
00:18:56,241 --> 00:19:01,440
I think letting people choose doctors
is a very bad idea, very messy.

266
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:05,992
Much tidier to allocate people to GPs, much fairer.

267
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:10,837
Then everyone has an equal chance
of getting the bad doctors.

268
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:15,199
- I see.
- In any case, we're talking about education.

269
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,352
With respect, Prime Minister,

270
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:22,720
I think that the DES will react with some caution
to your rather novel proposals.

271
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:27,033
- You mean they'll block it.
- They will give it urgent consideration

272
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:31,194
and insist on a thorough and rigorous examination
of all the proposals

273
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:34,831
allied to a detailed feasibility study
and budget analysis

274
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:40,029
before producing a consultative document
for consideration by all interested bodies

275
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:43,796
and seeking comments and recommendations
to be included in a brief

276
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:48,034
for a series of working parties
who will produce individual studies

277
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:52,194
which will provide the background
for a more wide-ranging document

278
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:58,118
considering whether or not the proposal
should be taken forward to the next stage.

279
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,353
- You mean they'll block it.
- Yeah.

280
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,073
- No problem.
- We thought you'd say that.

281
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:05,913
- We have a solution.
- Oh, yes?

282
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,833
We'll abolish the DES.

283
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,716
- I'm sorry?
- We'll abolish it.

284
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,031
- Abolish it?
- Why not?

285
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,510
Abolish Education and Science?!

286
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:23,074
- That'd be the end of civilisation as we know it!
- Only the department. Education will flourish.

287
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:27,553
- With no government department? Impossible!
- Departments are tombstones.

288
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,918
The Department of Industry
marks the grave of industry,

289
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,879
the Department of Employment,
that of employment,

290
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,238
the Department of Environment,
that of the environment.

291
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:42,270
And the Department of Education marks where
the corpse of British education is buried.

292
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,909
What does the DES do? What's its role?

293
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:47,800
I hardly know where to begin!

294
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:50,919
It lays down guidelines, it centralises

295
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:56,280
and channels money into education authorities,
University Grants Committee, it sets standards!

296
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,194
- Does it set the curriculum?
- It would like to!

297
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:03,149
- Select and change head teachers?
- Maintain school buildings?

298
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,959
- No...
- Set exams?

299
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:08,113
- No...
- Does it choose the children?

300
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:13,150
- How does it affect what a child does at school?
- It supplies 60% of the cash.

301
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:16,870
Why can't the cash
go from the Treasury to the schools?

302
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,590
Do we need 2,000 civil servants
to funnel money from A to B?

303
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:24,720
The DES also creates a legislative framework
for education.

304
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:30,160
Not much legislation. Environment could do that.
They deal with other local authority matters.

305
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,312
You can't be serious!

306
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:37,191
Who'd assess forward planning and staffing
variations, variations in pupil populations,

307
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,353
density of schooling required
in urban and rural areas?

308
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:44,309
- Who'd make sure everything ran properly?
- 2,500 private schools

309
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:48,679
seem to solve these problems every day
without any help from the DES.

310
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,435
They respond to changing circumstances.

311
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,991
- Supply and demand. It's easy.
- Who would plan for the future?

312
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,153
Education today is what the department planned?

313
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:01,074
Well, of... No, of course not!

314
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:05,234
- Is there anything else that the DES does?
- Well, it... it...

315
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:09,876
Well, we don't need it, then, do we? QED.

316
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,396
Quod erat demonstrandum.

317
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:19,029
I really... Quite unthinkable.

318
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:24,719
Once they start abolishing whole departments,
the very foundations of civilisation crumble.

319
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:29,591
- Barbarians at the gates.
- The return of the Dark Ages.

320
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:33,549
Did anything like this crop up
when you were Cabinet Secretary?

321
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:38,954
No. We let them amalgamate departments,
but that worked very well.

322
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:41,715
Yes, quite. You keep the existing staff

323
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:46,079
and you put in an extra layer
of coordinating management at the top.

324
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:52,350
Exactly. But you have to stop the liquidation
of the Department of Education, Humphrey.

325
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,718
Have you tried discrediting
the person who proposed it?

326
00:22:55,881 --> 00:23:00,318
No point. It was the Wainwright female,
so he's passing it off as his own idea.

327
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:05,919
- Discrediting the facts behind it?
- It's a political idea, so facts don't come into it.

328
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,796
- Massaging the figures?
- No figures are involved.

329
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:15,795
But it's hard to get the Prime Minister
to see that it's a bad idea.

330
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,557
Of course. It's actually a very good idea.
It just mustn't happen.

331
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:26,715
I wonder if we oughtn't to play along with it -
in the interests of the nation's children.

332
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:31,352
Never mind the nation's children.
What about our colleagues at the DES?

333
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:34,240
- Of course. Sorry.
- Let's be clear about this.

334
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:38,110
The only people who'll like this idea
are the parents and the children.

335
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,478
Everyone who counts will be against it.

336
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,996
- Teachers' unions.
- Local authorities.

337
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:48,200
- Educational press.
- And, of course, the DES.

338
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:53,993
- So what's the strategy?
- Unions can be counted on to disrupt the schools.

339
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:57,676
And go on TV saying
the government are causing the disruption.

340
00:23:57,841 --> 00:24:03,916
Good. Local councils will threaten to turn
the constituency parties against the government.

341
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:08,074
The Department of Education will delay
every stage of the process

342
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,438
and leak anything
that embarrasses the government.

343
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,991
We can help with that
at the Campaign for Freedom of Information.

344
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:16,913
Thank you, Arnold.

345
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,758
Ah, thanks.

346
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:26,352
But what are we actually... Thank you, Billy.
What's our argument?

347
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:32,029
Well, obviously, that this new proposal
will destroy our educational system.

348
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:36,399
- Everybody knows it's destroyed already.
- Well, we will say...

349
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:42,158
Sorry, the press will say that it's government
interference in the DES that destroyed it

350
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,994
and that this new plan will make things worse.

351
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:48,995
- Will that do the trick?
- It always has in the past.

352
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:55,680
- But this time the political pressure is stronger.
- You must find a political weapon to fight it with.

353
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,437
What political weapon
did you have in mind, Arnold?

354
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,198
I? That is your concern, Humphrey.

355
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:10,193
Your chance to prove yourself worthy
of the high office to which you've been called.

356
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:19,080
- The PM's ready to see you.
- What's it about?

357
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:23,632
- The abolition of the DES, I'm afraid.
- This is going to be bloody.

358
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:27,396
- There's a minor matter I need your advice...
- Is it important?

359
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,950
- Not important but urgent.
- What is it?

360
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:34,717
You know that enterprise school the PM visited,
when they gave him that stool?

361
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:38,920
It's just come to light that the wood
they were using was stolen.

362
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,072
Bernard, this is hardly...

363
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,798
Stolen?

364
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:50,796
Yes, it was government property
stolen from a YTS workshop last year.

365
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,752
How shocking.

366
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:58,596
It was referred to the DES,
as the theft came to light at a school.

367
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:01,912
They don't know whether to prosecute.
Sorry to bother...

368
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,470
Don't mention it, Bernard.

369
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,192
Show me in.

370
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,558
Come in, Humphrey. Come in, come in! Sit down.

371
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:18,600
Only one item on the agenda today -
the abolition of the DES.

372
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:23,710
Actually, if there's only one item, it's an agenDUM.

373
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:28,352
I don't think the Prime Minister's
got as far as the second declension.

374
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:33,959
I don't mind your scoring cheap debating points
since you've already lost the battle of the DES.

375
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:38,399
- The DES will be very upset.
- Does it matter since they'll cease to exist?

376
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:41,951
The process will take a few years.
They'll fight tooth and nail.

377
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:45,318
- What can they do to me?
- They're a formidable department.

378
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,791
- I am a formidable Prime Minister.
- Indeed you are.

379
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,759
But you might still need their cooperation.

380
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:56,631
Cooperation? From the Department of Education?
Don't make me laugh!

381
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:01,474
Fine, fine. I'll tell them to go ahead
with the prosecution, then.

382
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,760
- What prosecution?
- Oh, it's hardly worth bothering you with.

383
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:10,152
That enterprise school
where you were televised last week.

384
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:14,314
- Yes?
- The profits... A model for other schools...

385
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:16,472
Yes, yes, go on.

386
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:21,920
- The profits were the proceeds of theft.
- Theft? What do you mean, theft?

387
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:27,710
I mean removing goods without the knowledge
or consent of the owner with the intent of...

388
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,873
I know what theft means. What do YOU mean?

389
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,509
Well, the stool that they gave you

390
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,390
was made from wood appropriated
from the local YTS workshops.

391
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,951
- What do you mean?
- It was nicked.

392
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,351
By two of last year's pupils.

393
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:46,479
- A pair of nickers.
- Thank you, Bernard.

394
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,790
The YTS want to prosecute.

395
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:54,239
Now, the Department of Education
could stop them.

396
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:57,438
You know, return the wood and hush it up.

397
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:01,150
Millions saw me on TV saying
that school was an example!

398
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:03,881
Well, it is a sort of example.

399
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,793
They mustn't prosecute!

400
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:11,399
I hope the Department of Education won't leak
the fact that you're covering up for crooks.

401
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:15,554
- You must tell them not to prosecute.
- That would need their cooperation.

402
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:21,113
I can just see the newspapers -
"Jim's enterprising crooks.

403
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:26,913
"The Prime Minister has sat on the fence
for so long that now he's become one."

404
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,430
Persuade them not to prosecute.

405
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:37,312
It's very difficult to persuade people to cooperate
if they are actually under a death sentence.

406
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:40,757
- Death sentence?
- If you're abolishing the department.

407
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:42,840
Oh!

408
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,798
Oh, that!

409
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:48,871
No, that was just... a vague idea...

410
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,072
...of Dorothy's.

411
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:56,476
An idle thought. Nothing serious.

412
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:58,472
- You're sure?
- Positive.

413
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:03,431
Splendid, Prime Minister.
Shall we now continue with the agendum?

414
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,991
Agendum? Oh, yes!

415
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,992
We have no agendum.

416
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:12,358
(RHYTHMICALLY) We have no agendum today!

417
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:17,918
Business concluded. All right, Humphrey?

418
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,672
Yes, Prime Minister.
