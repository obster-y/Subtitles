1
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,053
Ah, Bernard,
how is our great statesman this afternoon?

2
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,608
- Very cheerful.
- What has he found to be cheerful about?

3
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:51,771
- Well, at Question Time he did very well.
- In whose opinion?

4
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:55,374
Everyone was impressed with his answer
on tapping MPs' phones.

5
00:00:55,538 --> 00:01:00,168
- I heard about that, but regrettably not from you.
- I didn't see any point.

6
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:05,207
I coordinate all government security.
Why was the question not referred to me first?

7
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:09,929
- It was an unforeseen supplementary.
- A foreseeable unforeseen supplementary.

8
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:15,092
It was a good answer. "Much as I respect
and value the opinions of this house,

9
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:22,016
"I have no desire to listen to honourable members
for any longer than I have to." Got a good laugh.

10
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:24,567
- From you.
- Yes, and from his own party.

11
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:27,730
Ones hoping to be promoted
or afraid of being sacked?

12
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:30,287
That's just about all of them.

13
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:34,974
I gather he denied that he'd authorised
the bugging of an MP's phone.

14
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:40,007
Well, yes. Well, he hasn't, has he?
Has he? He has? Crikey!

15
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:45,209
It's all here, Bernard, including the transcripts.
Shall we... um...

16
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:49,371
Can't we wait? He doesn't get many moments
of unalloyed pleasure.

17
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:51,529
I suppose he gets all he deserves.

18
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,654
- Prime Minister.
- Ah, come in!

19
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:59,209
- I want to talk about PM's Question Time.
- I accept your congratulations!

20
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:03,974
- Wasn't I brilliant? Didn't you think so?
- Well, I wasn't there, but...

21
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,129
- Wasn't I brilliant, Bernard?
- Er...

22
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:10,530
- Your replies will not be quickly forgotten.
- Let me tell you what happened.

23
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:16,489
The first question was about that cock-up over
the shortage of prison officers. Masterly reply!

24
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:21,129
I said, "I refer the honourable member
to the speech I made on October 28th."

25
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,892
- Did he remember what you'd said?
- No.

26
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:27,255
Neither did I, come to that. Still, it shut him up.

27
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:31,696
The next one was, "Did the Department
of Employment fiddle the figures?"

28
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:37,808
Restructure the base from which the statistics
have been derived without telling the public?

29
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:40,651
- Exactly. Fiddle the figures.
- Of course they do.

30
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,572
I know they do.
I said I'd found no significant evidence of it.

31
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:47,969
- You haven't looked.
- And we haven't shown you.

32
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:53,132
Well done. Then we went on to a googly about
the Dept of Energy's plans for nuclear waste.

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,893
- He wanted me to admit Cabinet was divided.
- Well, it is.

34
00:02:57,058 --> 00:03:00,368
I know. So I said,
"My cabinet took a unanimous decision."

35
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:03,928
You threatened to dismiss anyone
who wouldn't agree.

36
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:07,090
It certainly made them agree unanimously.

37
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:10,091
My back benchers were cheering my every word.

38
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:14,968
Oh, yes, then we had a question
about why our new anti-missile missile

39
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:19,177
was scrapped as obsolete
the day before it came off the production line.

40
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:23,729
- And how did you wriggle out of that one?
- That was my masterstroke!

41
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:25,889
My reply was sheer genius.

42
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:31,769
I said our policy had not been as effective
as we'd hoped. Clearly we had got it wrong.

43
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,930
- You admitted that?
- Yeah. Brilliant!

44
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,692
Took the wind right out of his sails!

45
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:43,936
Honesty always gives you the advantage
of surprise in the House of Commons.

46
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:49,730
The PM was also asked when he would request
the resignation from the responsible minister.

47
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:53,891
I said, "When he makes a mistake
that could've been seen at the time

48
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,253
"and not with the benefit of hindsight."

49
00:03:56,418 --> 00:04:00,093
They were on their feet cheering, stamping,
waving their order papers!

50
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:04,171
I gather there was a question
about the bugging of an MP's phone.

51
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:08,126
- Yes, I got a terrific laugh with that. I said...
- Bernard told me.

52
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:11,131
- I said, "Much as I respect..."
- Bernard told me.

53
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:16,053
Oh. Well, anyway, that was stupid.
Why should we bug Hugh Halifax's phone?

54
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,967
One of my own administration!
Where did they get such a daft idea?

55
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,606
- Sheer paranoia.
- The only thing is...

56
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:26,976
Why should we listen in to MPs?
Boring, stupid, ignorant windbags!

57
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:29,333
I do my best not to listen to them.

58
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:34,891
And he's only a PPS. I can't find out what's
going on at Defence. What could he know?

59
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:39,609
So I gather you denied that
Mr Halifax's phone had been bugged?

60
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:45,057
It was the one question to which I could give
a clear, simple, straightforward, honest answer.

61
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,053
Yes, unfortunately, although the answer
was clear, simple and straightforward,

62
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:56,612
it is difficult to justifiably assign to it the fourth
of the epithets you applied to the statement...

63
00:04:56,778 --> 00:05:01,374
...inasmuch as the precise correlation
between the information you communicated

64
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,247
and the facts insofar as
they can be determined and demonstrated

65
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,728
is such as to cause epistemological problems

66
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:14,211
of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the logical
and semantic resources of the English language

67
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:18,530
a heavier burden than
they can reasonably be expected to bear.

68
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,007
Epistemological? What are you talking about?

69
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:25,207
You... told a lie.

70
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:29,330
- A lie?
- A lie.

71
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:32,490
- What do you mean, a lie?
- I mean, you...

72
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,053
...lied.

73
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:40,211
I know this is a difficult concept
to get across to a politician.

74
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,334
You... er... (MUTTERS)

75
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,648
Ah, yes, you did not tell the truth.

76
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,695
We ARE bugging his phone?

77
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,849
- We were.
- When did we stop?

78
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:52,090
Um... 17 minutes ago.

79
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:56,536
- Well, you can't call that lying!
- What is the opposite of telling the truth?

80
00:05:56,698 --> 00:06:01,055
I mean, there was no intent.
I'd never knowingly mislead the House.

81
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:05,655
- Nonetheless you have done so.
- It wasn't my fault. I didn't know!

82
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:10,175
- You are deemed to have known.
- Why wasn't I told?

83
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,728
The Home Secretary
might not have felt the need to inform you.

84
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,492
- Why?
- Perhaps he didn't know either.

85
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,848
Or perhaps he'd been advised
that you did not need to know.

86
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:23,816
- I did need to know.
- The fact you needed to know

87
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:27,971
was not known at the time
that the now-known need to know was known.

88
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,734
Those that needed to advise the Home Secretary
felt that the information he needed

89
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:36,368
as to whether to inform the highest authority
was not yet known,

90
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,575
so there was no authority
for the authority to be informed

91
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:42,775
because the need to know
was not known or needed.

92
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:45,569
What?

93
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,573
- We could not know you'd deny it in the House.
- I would if I didn't know and were asked.

94
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:53,093
We did not know you'd be asked
when you didn't know.

95
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:57,251
I was bound to be asked when I didn't know
if I didn't know!

96
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,170
- What?
- What?

97
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:03,135
It was thought that it was better
not to inform you.

98
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:08,497
Halifax is one of your government team.
It was thought it was better not to create distrust.

99
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:11,855
- We only tell you when you should be aware.
- When's that?

100
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,771
You should now be aware
because you've denied it.

101
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:18,248
It would've been helpful if I'd been aware
before I denied it.

102
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,252
If you had been aware before you denied it,
you wouldn't have denied it.

103
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:26,457
- But I needed to know!
- We do not always tell you about bugging.

104
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:28,973
At times we need you not to know.

105
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,732
- Why did you decide I didn't?
- I didn't.

106
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:36,050
- Who did?
- Nobody. It was just nobody decided to tell you.

107
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,447
- It's the same thing!
- On the contrary.

108
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:44,612
To decide to conceal information from you
is a heavy burden for any official to shoulder,

109
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:49,249
but to decide not to reveal information to you
is routine procedure.

110
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:51,773
Humphrey, I need to know everything.

111
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,849
- Everything?
- Everything.

112
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,653
Very well.

113
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:02,016
Stationery deliveries this week.
Four dozen packets...

114
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:06,774
No, Humphrey, Humphrey, don't be silly.
I mean important things.

115
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:09,930
Who should decide what is important?

116
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:15,648
- How can you defend this cock-up?
- As you said in the House, we got it wrong.

117
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:21,017
- YOU got it wrong.
- I am merely a humble servant, a lowly official.

118
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:25,649
- The Home Secretary made the decision.
- Any reason I shouldn't ask him to resign?

119
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:29,128
You should only ask him to resign
when he's made a mistake

120
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:33,291
which could've been seen at the time
and not with the benefit of hindsight.

121
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,732
The trouble has arisen because of
your error of judgement in making this denial.

122
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:41,368
- What?
- You shouldn't have denied what you didn't know.

123
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:44,735
That was your fault.
You admitted keeping secrets from me.

124
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:49,096
The system works perfectly well
as long as the PM tells the Civil Service

125
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,852
everything he's going to say before he says it.

126
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:57,615
Lf, precipitantly, he says something without first
clearing it with us, he has only himself to blame.

127
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:03,728
You must not say anything without clearing it.
With respect, PM, you must learn discretion.

128
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:08,608
- There was nothing to be discreet about!
- There's always something to be discreet about.

129
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:12,532
Anyway, why are we bugging Hugh Halifax?
Is he talking to the Russians?

130
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,929
No, the French, actually.
That's much more serious.

131
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:20,335
- Why?
- The Russians already know what we're doing.

132
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:28,769
But the French are our trusted allies,
whatever you think of them. And who doesn't?

133
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:33,534
No, Prime Minister, actually the French
are our mistrusted allies.

134
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,169
That is why talking directly to the French
is regarded as an act of treason

135
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,647
by the Foreign Office... who authorised it.

136
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:44,208
- I don't know.
- You... don't know what?

137
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:48,530
- Who authorised it. Who authorised it?
- Is there an echo?

138
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:52,896
- Who authorised this bugging?
- The Foreign Office! I've just said.

139
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:57,495
Anyway, the less said the better.
Wouldn't you agree, Prime Minister?

140
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:01,367
- About what?
- About everything.

141
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:08,095
One cannot refuse to appear
before a House committee.

142
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:11,250
- No, sir.
- One shall have to tell them everything.

143
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:15,809
- Everything they can find out from other sources.
- Precisely.

144
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:21,769
But they are likely to ask me if the PM has ever
authorised the bugging of an MP's telephone.

145
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,089
So how should a loyal public servant reply?

146
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:30,457
Er, you could say it was a question for the PM
or the Foreign Secretary or the Home Office.

147
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:33,496
Or it was a security matter -
can't confirm or deny.

148
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:37,651
If I dodge the question,
do you know what the next question will be?

149
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:43,290
Why will I not give the same clear denial
that the PM gave the House yesterday?

150
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,052
- Ah.
- What should I say then, Bernard?

151
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:50,211
Well, you could say the Prime Minister
knows more about it than you do.

152
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:54,771
Then they'd know I was lying.

153
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:59,447
- So... what will you do?
- I don't know, Bernard.

154
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,610
I thought you should be aware of the dilemma.

155
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:07,898
- Would you like a glass of sherry, Bernard?
- Oh, yes, thank you. Sweet.

156
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:10,049
There's only dry.

157
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,048
Incidentally, Bernard, the BBC rang this morning.

158
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:18,927
- The BBC know about it?
- No, of course not.

159
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,215
They want to interview me for a documentary

160
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:25,768
they're making on Radio 3
about the structure of the government.

161
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:28,133
Gosh. You won't do it, will you?

162
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,937
- Why not?
- They may want you to say things.

163
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,807
That is quite normal on radio.

164
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:38,732
No, no, I mean interesting things. Controversy.

165
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:44,016
On the other hand,
one has a duty to put the record straight.

166
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:47,887
- You mean you want to do it?
- Well, not for oneself, of course.

167
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:51,812
No inclination for petty vanity,
you know, being a celebrity.

168
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:57,098
- But... one can be too self-effacing.
- I thought we were supposed to be faceless.

169
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,056
They don't show your face on radio.

170
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:03,654
They've said if I don't do it,
Arnold has said he would.

171
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,207
Perhaps that would be better.

172
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:10,770
Arnold? For myself, I would rather not do it.

173
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,328
But one's sense of duty compels one
to see that Arnold

174
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:17,331
is not held up as an example of a top civil servant.

175
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:22,694
You'll need clearance from the Prime Minister,
but that won't be a problem.

176
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:26,851
- How do you know?
- Well, it's on Radio 3. Nobody'll be listening.

177
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,773
- Ah, Prime Minister.
- Humphrey.

178
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:36,736
The Cabinet agenda, Prime Minister.

179
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:39,287
- Is it today you do your interview?
- Oh, yes.

180
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,813
- Any problems?
- Oh, no, no, no.

181
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,766
I have some experience
in dealing with difficult questions.

182
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:51,331
If you're evasive or confusing on the radio, they
edit you out. You've really got to say something.

183
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:54,490
- Say something?
- Something simple and interesting.

184
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,126
Simple and interesting.

185
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:02,531
Perhaps you could advise me, Prime Minister,
particularly if the questions are aggressive.

186
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,690
Even better. That puts listeners on your side.

187
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:10,852
- I may have to answer them.
- Why? You've never answered my questions.

188
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,010
No, no, no, that's different, Prime Minister.

189
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:19,852
Ludovic Kennedy might ask me
some perceptive questions.

190
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:26,056
His researchers mentioned that lots of people
are interested to know

191
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,937
why so much power is centralised in my hands.

192
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,091
Lots of people?
Hardly anybody's ever heard of you, Humphrey!

193
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:39,370
- Perhaps they meant lots of Radio 3 listeners.
- That's a contradiction in terms!

194
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:44,737
If he does say that lots of people want to know
the answer to that question, say, "Name six."

195
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:49,528
That'll fix him.
He'll never be able to remember more than two.

196
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,496
Oh, excellent, Prime Minister. Any more tricks?

197
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:55,855
Tricks, Humphrey? This is technique.

198
00:13:56,018 --> 00:14:02,014
Attack one word in the sentence. Like frequently.
"Frequently? What do you mean, frequently?"

199
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:07,377
Or attack the interviewer. "You've clearly
never read the white paper, have you?"

200
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,529
Or else ask your own question.

201
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:13,737
"That was a very interesting question.
Now let me ask you a question." See?

202
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,688
Oh, thank you, Prime Minister.

203
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:22,251
That reminds me, I have shortly
to appear before the committee

204
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,888
to answer questions
about the alleged bugging of an MP's phone.

205
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:31,610
Yes. Yes, Bernard told me. Well, you'll just
have to confirm what I said in the House.

206
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,968
- But that would be lying.
- Well, nobody'd know.

207
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:41,129
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

208
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,415
You must.
Otherwise it'll look as though I was lying.

209
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,494
Humphrey, you have a loyalty.

210
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,692
To the truth.

211
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:58,808
I'm sorry, Prime Minister, I cannot become
involved in some shabby cover-up.

212
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:08,535
Whereas there must be some element of shared
responsibility for the governance of Britain,

213
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,089
as between the legislators on the one hand
and the administration on the other,

214
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:19,254
the precise allocation of cause to consequence
or agency to eventuality in any particular instance

215
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,855
is invariably so complex as to be
ultimately invalid if not irresponsible.

216
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:26,816
I see, but could you be a bit more precise?

217
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:30,766
How far is the Civil Service to blame
for the level of unemployment?

218
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,816
Yes, of course, unemployment is a single name
applied by the media

219
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:38,135
to what is a wide range
of socio-economic phenomena

220
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:41,768
whose most politically visible manifestation
happens to be...

221
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:46,568
- Could you be a little bit more precise...
- I'm so sorry, Mr Kennedy.

222
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:50,526
You've asked me the question.
Do allow me to answer it.

223
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,496
There happens to be a current frequency

224
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:57,856
of weekly registrations
on the National Unemployment Register

225
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:02,216
which is deemed to be above
what has been held to be an acceptable level.

226
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:07,611
But even separating out the component causes,
let alone allocating responsibility for them,

227
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,372
is a task of such analytical delicacy

228
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:16,135
as not to be susceptible of compression within
the confines of a popular radio programme.

229
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:20,211
Sir Humphrey Appleby, thank you very much.

230
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:25,850
If that was a popular programme,
what would an unpopular programme be like?

231
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,010
Thank you, Sir Humphrey. Absolutely splendid.

232
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:32,693
My pleasure. Was I all right?

233
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,055
Couldn't you have said a bit more
about unemployment?

234
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:39,415
- Such as?
- Well... the truth.

235
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:42,138
- (HUMPHREY LAUGHS)
- Why do you laugh?

236
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:46,769
Oh, my dear Ludo,
nobody tells the truth about unemployment.

237
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:50,248
- Why not?
- Because everybody knows you can halve it.

238
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:53,012
- But how?
- Cut off all Social Security

239
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,772
to any claimant who refuses two job offers.

240
00:16:55,938 --> 00:17:00,329
There's genuine unemployment in the north,
but the south is awash with layabouts,

241
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:04,093
many of them graduates living off the dole
and housing benefit

242
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:07,614
plus quite a lot of cash they pick up
without telling anybody.

243
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,248
- You mean moonlighting?
- Well, sunlighting, really.

244
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:16,890
Most employers will tell you they're short-staffed,
but offer the unemployed a street-sweeping job,

245
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:20,767
they'd be off the register
before you could say "parasite".

246
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:25,932
This country can have as much unemployment
as it's prepared to pay for in Social Security.

247
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:29,010
No politicians have got the guts to do anything.

248
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:33,171
- (LUDOVIC) Oh, I do wish you'd said that.
- (HUMPHREY) I'm sure you do.

249
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:40,613
- Sir Humphrey...
- Oh, come along.

250
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,975
- What's this for?
- The BBC have just sent me this tape.

251
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:50,008
Apparently, it's part of my interview.
They say it's particularly interesting.

252
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:55,216
- Your interview?
- You're surprised I said something interesting?

253
00:17:55,378 --> 00:18:00,975
No, no, it's just that I thought you intended
to say nothing, as always. I mean...

254
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:04,210
Switch it on, Bernard. You may learn something.

255
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:09,935
<i>... Ludo, nobody tells the truth</i>
<i>about unemployment.</i>

256
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:14,250
- <i>Why not?</i>
- <i>Because everyone knows you can halve it...</i>

00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:20,013

259
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,887
<i>No politicians have got the guts to do anything.</i>

260
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,930
Sir Humphrey, that wasn't you, was it?

261
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:36,051
- Yes, Bernard.
- But how could you say such things?

262
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:38,209
Is there any more?

263
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:50,447
- Yes, Bernard.
- As damaging as what we've just heard?

264
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,767
More damaging.

265
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:57,736
I believe I referred to... parasites.

266
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:01,368
- How could you be so indiscreet?
- The interview was over!

267
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:05,292
- We were just chatting! It was off the record!
- It was on the tape!

268
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:10,537
Oh, my God, I've just realised! Blackmail.

269
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:13,132
- Blackmail?
- Read that.

270
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:18,133
"Here is a copy of your off-the-record
part of the interview. Very interesting.

271
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,973
- "We will contact you shortly."
- What do they want of me?

272
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:25,130
The BBC? Licence fee up 50%?

273
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:30,133
- Maybe it's a private blackmail by the producer.
- Maybe.

274
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,017
Doesn't he know I'm a poor man?

275
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:36,966
Maybe he hasn't read you live in abject poverty
on 81,000 a year.

276
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:45,093
- What am I going to do?
- Keep your mouth shut in future.

277
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:49,729
And so must you! Don't breathe a word
about this to anyone! Anyone!

278
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,890
- My duty to the...
- (SPLUTTERS)

279
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,173
Oh, Bernard, what am I going to do?

280
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:02,650
Well, put out a press statement
expressing sympathy for the unemployed.

281
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:06,130
- Sympathy?
- You may be joining them any moment.

282
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:18,051
- Yes, Bernard?
- Excuse me, are you busy?

283
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:24,088
I am. I'm expecting Humphrey. I've got to decide
what to tell the Cabinet about this bugging.

284
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,933
Do I tell them the truth...
or do I tell them what I told the House?

285
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:33,650
Perhaps you should behave to the Cabinet
as you would expect them to behave to you.

286
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:38,048
You're quite right.
I'll tell them what I've told the House.

287
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:41,009
(COUGHS SIGNIFICANTLY)

288
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:44,454
- Something else?
- Yes, there is something you need to know.

289
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:48,892
- Need to know?
- Yes, it's about Sir Humphrey's broadcast.

290
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:52,972
- Boring?
- Initially, yes.

291
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:56,494
Then it livened up
as he became more and more indiscreet.

292
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:58,694
Humphrey? Indiscreet?

293
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:03,249
He thought the broadcast was over.
He was chatting, but the tape was still running.

294
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:05,613
- He fell for that old dodge?
- Yes.

295
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:10,090
You should always treat every microphone
as if it were live. Doesn't he know that?

296
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:13,648
- He hasn't done a lot of broadcasting.
- What did he say?

297
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:17,936
We could halve unemployment,
but the government hasn't the guts.

298
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:22,455
- What?!
- He didn't know he was being recorded.

299
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:29,137
And the BBC has the original? You know what
this means. All over the papers. Do something!

300
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:33,849
I already have. I had lunch with the producer.
He and I were at Oxford together.

301
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:36,407
He never intended to release the tape,

302
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:40,617
so I got him to give me the indiscreet bit
from the master tape.

303
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,449
This is the original?

304
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,496
Does Humphrey know you've got it?

305
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,857
- Shall I tell him?
- Why?

306
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,615
- I think he'd like to know.
- I'm sure he would.

307
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:05,167
But does he NEED to know?

308
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:10,689
Ah, somebody needs to know, but now you know,
Sir Humphrey doesn't need to know.

309
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:16,012
You need to know Sir Humphrey doesn't know,
but he doesn't need to know you know.

310
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:19,693
Thank you, Bernard,
I couldn't have put it less clearly myself.

311
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:22,656
- Like to hear the tape?
- Can you play this?

312
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:26,208
Oh, no, not that. I got him to give me a copy.

313
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,849
Oh, no, hold on a minute.
I think this deserves a wider audience.

314
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:34,408
- I think Humphrey ought to hear this.
- (BUZZER)

315
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,537
Yes?

316
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:40,371
Oh. It is Sir Humphrey.

317
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:44,292
What a happy coincidence.
Ask him to join us, Bernard.

318
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:50,169
Will you hold on a moment? Prime Minister,
I did tell you all this in confidence.

319
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,568
And I respect your confidence.

320
00:22:55,538 --> 00:23:00,293
- This is serious, you know, Bernard.
- Oh, er, yes, Prime Minister.

321
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,889
Sir Humphrey.

322
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:11,653
Ah, Humphrey, come in, come in, come in!
(CHUCKLES)

323
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,492
- How did your broadcast go?
- Oh, very well, very well.

324
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:20,255
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing in particular.

325
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:24,696
I pointed out some of the difficulties
in allocating responsibilities

326
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:27,770
as between politicians and civil servants.

327
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:31,567
- But you were discreet?
- Why do you ask?

328
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,729
- Were you or weren't you?
- Yes.

329
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:36,856
- Yes, you were or yes, you weren't?
- Yes.

330
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:40,727
- Humpy?
- Wouldn't you expect me to be discreet?

331
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:43,696
- Of course.
- There you are, then.

332
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,928
Good. Well, that's all right, then.

333
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,975
Why do you ask?

334
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,732
It's just that the BBC sent me a tape.

335
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:58,375
- A tape? What tape?
- A tape of your broadcast.

336
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,574
I thought we might listen to it.

337
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,047
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Why not?

338
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,413
- It isn't interesting.
- Not interesting?

339
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,934
- The Cabinet Secretary talking to the nation?
- Not VERY.

340
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:12,056
You mean you were too discreet?

341
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,527
Play it, would you, Bernard?

342
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:17,451
<i>Nobody tells the truth about unemployment.</i>

343
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:21,213
- <i>Why not?</i>
- <i>Because everyone knows you can halve it.</i>

344
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,972
- <i>How?</i>
- <i>Cut off all Social Security</i>

345
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,050
<i>to all claimants who refuse two j'ob offers.</i>

346
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,209
<i>There's genuine unemployment...</i>

347
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:32,370
- Humphrey!
- I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know!

348
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,735
- The interview was over!
- The indiscretion!

349
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:38,048
- The irresponsibility! Any more?
- No.

350
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:41,415
- Yes.
- Play it, Bernard.

351
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:45,127
<i>... be off the register</i>
<i>before you could say "parasite".</i>

352
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:50,326
<i>This country can have as much unemployment</i>
<i>as it's prepared to pay for in Social Security.</i>

353
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:54,776
- <i>No politicians have the guts to do anything.</i>
- You said that?!

354
00:24:57,338 --> 00:24:59,329
It was Mike Yarwood.

355
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:08,212
I'm in somewhat of a difficulty
as to know what to do about this.

356
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:12,530
I need advice. Perhaps I ought to play it
to the Cabinet, get their reaction.

357
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,166
- Oh, please!
- Or the Privy Counsel.

358
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:19,126
- Or... Her Majesty?
- Oh, God!

359
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:23,086
Do you realise what damage it would do
if it got into the papers?

360
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:26,853
I could say I got it wrong!
I've checked and it isn't true!

361
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,009
- But it is.
- I could say it isn't!

362
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:33,410
- Nobody can prove it, it's never been tried!
- You'd tell an untruth in public?

363
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:39,926
- Yes, for YOU! We can issue a clarification.
- You've already made yourself very clear.

364
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:45,536
Prime Minister, a clarification is not to make
oneself clear, it is to put oneself in the clear.

365
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:48,534
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

366
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:55,607
Give me the tape, would you, Bernard?
Now I've got something to tell you.

367
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:57,575
This is a copy,

368
00:25:57,738 --> 00:26:01,936
but this is the original, the master.

369
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:05,056
- You mean...
- They were retrieved from the BBC.

370
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,655
By whom?

371
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,888
Intelligence.

372
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,972
So... no one else will ever know?

373
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:17,175
That rather depends on what I choose to tell them.

374
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:21,331
Of course, I could just hand over the tapes or...

375
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:28,009
...I could hold onto them while I consider
the security and disciplinary implications.

376
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:32,012
I certainly have no intention of joining
"some shabby cover-up".

377
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:37,812
Oh, that reminds me, have you decided yet
what you'll tell the Privileges Committee?

378
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:43,371
Oh, yes, yes, Prime Minister. I've decided that,
in the interests of national security,

379
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:48,214
that, um, the only honourable course
is to support your statement in the House.

380
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:51,973
And say that Hugh Halifax's phone
has never been bugged?

381
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,493
- And say I have no evidence...
- No!

382
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:59,288
And say the government has never authorised
the bugging of MPs' phones.

383
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:04,816
And say... the government has never author...
Supposing they find out the truth?

384
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:08,288
You'll just have to say that nobody told you

385
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,655
because you didn't need to know.

386
00:27:11,818 --> 00:27:13,968
- Agreed?
- (SIGHS)

387
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,129
Splendid. That's settled, then.

388
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:19,298
May one have one's tapes back?

389
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,895
Tomorrow.

390
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:30,292
After the Committee on Privileges.
All right, Humphrey?

391
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,849
Yes, Prime Minister.
