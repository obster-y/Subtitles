1
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:44,971
- Alan, it's really a very reasonable plan.
- Tell that to the Chief of Defence Staff.

2
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:50,129
- Why is he late? Not very soldierly.
- It's this plan. The Ministry's in turmoil.

3
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:53,446
It's a relocation proposal,
not a Russian invasion.

4
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:58,006
Be all right if it was.
We know what we could do to repel that.

5
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,973
- Could you repel it?
- No.

6
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:06,926
- But we don't have to do any thinking about it.
- Let's look at this from the PM's point of view.

7
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:10,087
We have 420,000 service personnel.

8
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:14,851
Only 20,000 are stationed in the north.
Almost everything's in the south.

9
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:19,406
Navy at Portsmouth, Air Force in Bedford
and the Army in Aldershot.

10
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:23,329
Almost nothing north of The Wash
where the unemployment is.

11
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,771
- Servicemen come from the north.
- But spend in the south.

12
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,733
Inevitable. That's where they are now.

13
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:34,127
Anyway, there's nothing to spend it on
in the north, is there?

14
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,492
- Chief of Defence Staff.
- This cannot happen...

15
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:41,614
Don't attack me, I'm on your side,
but it is a strong argument.

16
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:47,805
Move 200,000 or 300,000 service personnel
up north and you create masses of civilian jobs.

17
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,773
Clerks, suppliers, builders, vehicle maintenance.

18
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,972
300,000 extra pay packets spent in the shops.

19
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,808
You can't move thousands of men like that.

20
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:02,447
- I thought that's what you did with armies.
- You bring 'em back! This'd be permanent.

21
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:06,733
Guy, can any servicemen be stationed
permanently in the north?

22
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,614
I suppose other ranks, junior officers,

23
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:14,371
but you can't ask senior officers
to live permanently in the north!

24
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,005
The wives wouldn't stand for it for one thing.
Children's schools.

25
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:21,326
I understand there are schools
in the north of England.

26
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:27,092
What about Harrods? What about Wimbledon?
Ascot? Henley? The Army and Navy Club?

27
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:31,407
I mean civilisation, generally! It's just not on!

28
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:34,043
This is being discussed in Cabinet.

29
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:39,414
We need more serious arguments than senior
officers' wives being 300 miles from Harrods.

30
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:43,329
What's more serious?!
Chaps like us might have to move up there!

31
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,692
But are there any strategic arguments
against the move?

32
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:51,975
- We can find those against anything.
- But would they stand up to expert scrutiny?

33
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:57,129
They won't get expert scrutiny. We'll make it
top secret like we always do with defence.

34
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:02,494
- Prime Minister only.
- Then they certainly won't get expert scrutiny.

35
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:07,854
But I wonder whether we might not do better
to play the man instead of the ball.

36
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,609
- Which man?
- The Employment Secretary.

37
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:14,165
- This was his suggestion.
- Ah, yes.

38
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:18,010
Suggest to the PM
the Employment Secretary is plotting against him.

39
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:20,643
- Is he?
- Not as far as I know.

40
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:25,969
But the question is whether the Prime Minister
can be made to believe that he is.

41
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,171
Any chance of getting rid of him?

42
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:32,613
- The PM? He's only just house-trained.
- The Employment Secretary.

43
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,970
Field Marshal, are you suggesting

44
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:39,970
humble civil servants should presume to remove
a member of HM Government from Cabinet?

45
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,933
- Yes.
- Out of the question.

46
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:46,087
Only the Prime Minister can remove ministers,

47
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:51,283
but if the Prime Minister came to suspect
the loyalty of a member of his Cabinet...

48
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:56,734
Only someone with advanced paranoia would
suspect the Employment Secretary of a plot.

49
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,887
Really? Then we're in with a chance.

50
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:06,652
Other business. Employment Secretary,
you wanted views on your paper.

51
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,524
Yes, my plan to reduce unemployment
in the northeast

52
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:14,165
by moving various
defence establishments up there.

53
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,530
Defence Secretary, what's your view?

54
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:18,686
I know, on the face of it,

55
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:22,894
this plan looks as though it benefits
employment in depressed areas,

56
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:28,652
but this is to be achieved, as I understand it,
by relocating most defence establishments.

57
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:32,933
This affects the Defence Department
as well as Employment.

58
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:38,647
- I need time to do a feasibility study.
- Anybody else have an opinion? Quickly.

59
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:43,206
I don't know much about it,
but it does sound a serious upheaval.

60
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,366
- Expensive.
- A big move.

61
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,526
I'm in favour of the proposal.

62
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:50,926
- So am I.
- Absolutely!

63
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:54,849
Looks as though the Defence Secretary
is in a minority of one.

64
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:59,850
I am the responsible minister.
The defence of the realm is in question.

65
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:03,724
We'll have a full discussion
at our next meeting on Friday

66
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,363
and then put it to Cabinet for approval.

67
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:10,323
Thank you. May I request
that it be noted in the minutes

68
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:15,444
that the Cabinet Committee was in favour
of my plan save for one member?

69
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,608
The member whose department
would be reorganised. It's a problem.

70
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:25,008
May I remind the Secretary of State for Defence
that every problem is also an opportunity?

71
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,530
(CABINET) Hear hear!

72
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:33,884
The Secretary of State for Defence fears that
this may create some insoluble opportunities.

73
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,011
Nonsense.

74
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:48,454
- Er, Prime Minister...
- Oh, still here, Humphrey?

75
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:54,167
Yes. I wonder if I could have a word with you
about the Employment Secretary's plan.

76
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:59,930
- Yes, terrific, isn't it?
- The service chiefs aren't entirely happy.

77
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,813
Good.

78
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:06,690
- Do I have your full attention?
- Of course you do.

79
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,449
- I'm just reading these notes.
- Mm-hm.

80
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:13,005
Prime Minister, there's been
an earthquake in Haslemere.

81
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,093
Good.

82
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,733
- What?
- The service chiefs don't like this plan.

83
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,649
Taking their wives
away from Wimbledon and Harrods!

84
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,526
Prime Minister, that is unworthy.
Their personal feelings don't come into it.

85
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:37,007
- Their objections are entirely strategic.
- Oh, strategic, of course.

86
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:42,772
The Admiralty needs a deep-water port
so that has to be at Bath, 30 miles inland.

87
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,565
The job of the Marines is to defend Norway,
so we station them at Plymouth.

88
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:53,093
Army vehicle trials take place in Scotland, so
the engineering establishment has to be in Surrey.

89
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,486
Well, these are just isolated examples.

90
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,884
I've got another 700 isolated examples.

91
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,764
- Why are you against it, Humphrey?
- I assure you I'm not against it.

92
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:09,974
I'm simply furnishing you with
the appropriate questions - like that of cost.

93
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,729
That's the beauty of it - it makes money.

94
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,174
We sell all these expensive properties
in the south and move "up north"!

95
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:21,133
You think the Employment Secretary
has done well?

96
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:25,083
- Indeed I do. He's a good chap.
- Oh, I quite agree.

97
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,611
Absolutely brilliant.

98
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,766
Superb intellect.

99
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:35,531
Strong footwork, excellent elbows.
A major figure, without a doubt.

100
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:39,847
- He's not that good.
- But he is a good chap, wouldn't you say?

101
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:43,564
- I've just said so.
- Oh, yes, indeed. Very popular.

102
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,295
- Is he?
- Oh, yes!

103
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:48,844
- Not as popular as that, surely?
- Oh, yes.

104
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:53,327
- In Whitehall and with the parliamentary party.
- I suppose, yes.

105
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,373
- And with the grass roots, I'm told.
- Are you?

106
00:07:56,535 --> 00:08:00,210
- And he has quite a following in Cabinet, too.
- Does he?

107
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,254
People are beginning to talk about him
as the next Prime Minister.

108
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:09,614
- What... What do you mean?
- Oh, I mean when you decide to retire.

109
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:16,374
I'm not going to retire! I've only just got here!
Why are people talking about the next PM?

110
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:19,447
I'm sure it's just general speculation.

111
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:24,647
- Does he want to be Prime Minister?
- Well, even if he does...

112
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:28,285
...surely you've got no reason
to suspect his loyalty?

113
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:31,845
He isn't planning to build up
a personal following, is he?

114
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,609
Isn't he?

115
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:38,927
- Is he?
- Spends a hell of a lot of time making speeches.

116
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:43,725
Only as a loyal minister. I'm sure
he pays tributes to you in them, doesn't he?

117
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:47,490
Does he? Bernard, get me his last six speeches.

118
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:51,045
Er, yes, I'm just getting them, Prime Minister.

119
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:53,934
He chats up back benchers in the tea room.

120
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,292
You told ministers to take more trouble
to communicate.

121
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,891
- And he has them round to dinner parties.
- Oh, does he?

122
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:04,092
- Worrying.
- The Employment Secretary's speeches.

123
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,251
I'm sure he talked about the new PM bringing
new hope to Britain, the dawn of a new age.

124
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:16,570
You know, that leaflet you told Party HQ
to issue to all MPs and constituencies.

125
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:21,206
- No, not a word.
- Oh, now that IS odd.

126
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,368
It's more than odd, it's suspicious.
Bloody suspicious!

127
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:29,323
Even so,
he surely isn't actively plotting against you.

128
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,055
- Isn't he?
- Is he?

129
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:36,606
- How do I know he's not?
- I'm sure you can always find out.

130
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:41,766
- Get me the Chief Whip.
- Yes, Prime Minister. Get me the Chief Whip.

131
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:45,723
- Now!
- Now! Oh, hello, Chief Whip.

132
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:49,490
Are you at No.12?
The PM wants to see you urgently.

133
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,249
- Now!
- Now! Thank you.

134
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,250
- Sir Humphrey.
- Yes?

135
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:03,248
- I'm troubled by what I've learned.
- What?

136
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:09,092
I feel I've had my eyes shut. I never realised
there was a plot against the Prime Minister.

137
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:13,205
Is there? How interesting.

138
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,163
- But you said there was.
- I said nothing, nothing at all.

139
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,327
You mean... Oh.

140
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,963
- Do you know if there is a plot?
- No.

141
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:26,207
- No, there isn't? Or, no, you don't know?
- Yes.

142
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,765
What exactly
has the Employment Secretary done?

143
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:35,645
- Nothing yet, and we must keep it that way.
- But isn't his plan a good one?

144
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,806
- For whom?
- The country.

145
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,443
- That is hardly the point.
- Why not?

146
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:44,813
Bernard, when you move on from here,
where do you plan to go?

147
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:48,126
Well, I... er... I... I don't know.

148
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:52,846
- Like to be in charge of defence procurement?
- Oh, gosh...

149
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:57,213
- In Sunderland or Berwick or Lossiemouth?
- Is that a place?

150
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,970
- Lossiemouth? What'd you think it was?
- A dog food.

151
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:07,765
If the Employment Secretary has his way,
you may get a diet of Lossiemouth.

152
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,653
- See?
- Yes.

153
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,409
- How can it be good for the country?
- It can't.

154
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:16,170
Why will the Chief Whip confirm a plot
that doesn't exist?

155
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:22,524
He's bound to hedge. The Chief Whip cannot
state that there's no plot just in case there is.

156
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:27,166
- He has to cover himself. Good morning.
- Could you wait in the private office?

157
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:32,455
Bernard... now go in there
and inform me of their conversation.

158
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:35,175
I'm not sure I can. It might be confidential.

159
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:40,728
Bernard, the matter at issue is the defence of
the realm and the stability of the government.

160
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:43,807
You only need to know things
on a need-to-know basis.

161
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:46,808
I need to know everything!

162
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:51,894
How else can I judge whether or not
I need to know it?

163
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,208
So you need to know things
even when you don't need to know them?

164
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:02,085
You need to know them because you need
to know whether or not you need to know.

165
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,965
If you don't need to know, you need to know
so you know there was no need to know.

166
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:10,127
- Yes!
- Good. That's very clear.

167
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,730
Chief Whip, Prime Minister.

168
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,126
Morning, Prime Minister.

169
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:27,453
- How are things going, Chief Whip?
- Oh, quite well, really. Why?

170
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:32,693
- You've noticed nothing?
- Well, it's a difficult time.

171
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,847
Bit of unrest on the back benches...

172
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:40,167
What... did you have in mind precisely?

173
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,371
A plot. A leadership challenge?

174
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:46,053
Ah. Yes...

175
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:51,253
Well, actually,
I have no real evidence of anything.

176
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:55,124
- But you have suspicions?
- Oh, I always have suspicions.

177
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:59,925
- How far has it got?
- Oh, only a very... um... very... um...

178
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:04,407
- Early stage?
- Early stage. As far as one can tell.

179
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,809
Should you have a word with him?

180
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:13,652
I don't want to lose him from the Cabinet.
I... just want him under control.

181
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:16,852
Perhaps you should
have a word with him yourself.

182
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:21,486
No, no, no, no. No, not at this stage.
Who else is involved?

183
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:23,646
Apart from...

184
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:29,446
- Apart from Dudley, obviously.
- Dudley?

185
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:34,405
Yes, of course, apart from Dudley.
Well, apart from Dudley...

186
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:40,610
Well, it's... um... It's a bit early to say.
There may be nothing in it.

187
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:44,245
- I'm not taking any risks.
- No, absolutely not!

188
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,532
I'll go and make a few more enquiries.

189
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,811
(TO HIMSELF) Dudley?

190
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,567
Yes.

191
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:57,525
I presume the PM's in favour of the scheme
because it'll reduce unemployment.

192
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,687
It'll look as if he's reducing unemployment.

193
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,574
Or look as if he's TRYING to reduce it.

194
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:08,604
Whereas he's only trying to look
as if he's trying to reduce unemployment.

195
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:15,374
Because he's worried that it doesn't LOOK as if
he's trying to look as if he's trying to reduce it.

196
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:19,323
- So how are you going to stop it?
- Well, Arnold, the Prime Minis...

197
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,690
The PM has come to suspect

198
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:26,292
the plan may be the start of a leadership bid
by the Employment Secretary.

199
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:31,734
How ridiculous, but the higher the office,
the higher the level of paranoia.

200
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:35,604
Fortunately, yes,
but paranoia needs something to feed on.

201
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,767
Nothing like press leaks for paranoia fodder.

202
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:44,248
What if there should be a headline about
the Employment Secretary's brilliant plan

203
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:46,610
being blocked by the Prime Minister?

204
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:50,609
- Man overboard!
- With any luck.

205
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:55,053
But the trouble is a Cabinet Secretary
cannot be party to a leak.

206
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:59,686
- No, of course not.
- Whereas a FORMER Cabinet Secretary...

207
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:06,447
Presumably, as chairman of
the Campaign for Freedom of Information,

208
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:11,370
you have a...
a duty to make certain facts available.

209
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,448
Are you suggesting I give
confidential information to the press?

210
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,765
Certainly not, Arnold.

211
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,927
This is confidential disinformation.

212
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:23,211
Ah, that's different.

213
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:32,892
Oh, excuse me. Is that the evening paper
for the Prime Minister? May I? Thank you.

214
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:39,486
Ah, good.
Look, I have to have an urgent word with him.

215
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:45,651
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to bring that in
in, say, three minutes. Thank you.

216
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:52,533
- Thank you, Bernard.
- Humphrey, I know what's been going on!

217
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,413
- You do?
- Yes!

218
00:15:54,575 --> 00:16:00,764
A scheme has been hatched behind my back,
a disloyal, treacherous plot, and I won't tolerate it.

219
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,244
- I've spoken to the Chief Whip.
- And?

220
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:08,205
He says he has his suspicions.
He's going to make enquiries.

221
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,685
He can't tell me more
till he has something solid. You see?

222
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:15,245
- What?
- The Employment Secretary is plotting!

223
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:20,125
- Come on, Humphrey!
- Well, I must say, I am surprised.

224
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:24,772
I should've thought all your Cabinet were loyal.

225
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:28,530
Loyal! You know what loyalty
in a Cabinet minister means?

226
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:33,325
His fear of losing his own job is slightly greater
than his hope of pinching mine.

227
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:35,884
But with collective responsibility...

228
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:39,843
If we do something popular,
they leak that it was their idea.

229
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,052
If it's unpopular, they leak they were against it.

230
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,924
We're governed on the principle
of collective irresponsibility.

231
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,655
- Hah hah (!)
- Why do they want your job?

232
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:55,890
Because I'm the only member of the government
who can't be sent to Northern Ireland next week.

233
00:16:56,055 --> 00:17:01,254
I can't believe that the Employment Secretary
is actively plotting against you.

234
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:03,610
What more proof do you want?

235
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:09,691
This proposal to send defence establishments
up north is bound to be leaked to the press.

236
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:13,245
- Bound to be.
- If it were leaked as HIS plan,

237
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:17,727
it'd confirm your suspicions,
but I'm sure it'll go out as a government plan.

238
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:21,604
- Are you? I'm not.
- Ah, the evening paper.

239
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:30,892
Good God! Look! Swine!
There's your proof, Humphrey!

240
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,849
Good heavens, I'm astonished.

241
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:40,405
"Sources in Whitehall report
that this imaginative plan,

242
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:43,726
"an initiative by the Employment Secretary,

243
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:46,887
"has been blocked by the Prime Minister"?!

244
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:49,250
How dare he!

245
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,565
How dare he! I'm... I'm...

246
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,203
- Speechless?
- Speechless!

247
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,850
I've backed him all along!
I've fought for his sodding plan!

248
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:02,610
I gave him his first Cabinet post,
treated him like a son!

249
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,845
This is the thanks I get!

250
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:09,850
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
to have a thankless Cabinet colleague.

251
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:12,927
It's envy. Dudley is consumed with envy.

252
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,484
It's one of the seven Dudley sins.

253
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:26,371
Prime Minister, shall we start to draft
your letter accepting his resignation?

254
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:30,323
It's not that simple.
He'll deny he leaked, so why am I sacking him?

255
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:36,206
He'll be more dangerous on the back benches.
Sacked, he doesn't have to pretend to be loyal.

256
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:42,211
- So you mean you'll go ahead with his plan?
- I can't. Not now.

257
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:47,574
It'll look as though he's defeated me.
I can't risk that. It's a good plan.

258
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:51,569
So... perha... Er... no, no, I...

259
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:55,284
Prime Minister, you're not being indecisive,
are you?

260
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:58,447
No, no!

261
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:03,609
- No, I just can't make up my mind.
- Well, perhaps I can help.

262
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,972
- How?
- Technically, I shouldn't be showing you this.

263
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,491
- Why not? I'm Prime Minister, aren't I?
- Indeed you are!

264
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,174
That's why I shouldn't show it to you.

265
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:19,807
It's a Ministry of Defence draft internal paper.
The Secretary of Defence hasn't seen it yet.

266
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:25,174
- But it casts grave doubts on the plan.
- Does it?

267
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:29,123
Many of the valuable buildings he quotes
can't be sold.

268
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:34,289
Some are listed, some have planning controls.
The cost of the move would be prohibitive.

269
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:38,164
It'd create unemployment
in the Home Counties and East Anglia

270
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:44,729
and in Part 3 there are pages and pages of
objections on the grounds of military strategy.

271
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:49,491
- And all this is honest and accurate?
- It comes from the Ministry of Defence.

272
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,487
Even so, it COULD be honest and accurate.

273
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,693
You know, I think the public
has a right to know this.

274
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:03,690
It is a top-secret document.

275
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:11,291
On the other hand, the service chiefs
are notorious for their indiscretion.

276
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:15,334
It could find its way into the hands
of some irresponsible journalist.

277
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:20,205
- Quite. Or several irresponsible...
- Several, indeed, Prime Minister.

278
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,970
- Of course, I could never be a party to that.
- Certainly not.

279
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:28,731
So, shall we defer further discussion
of the Employment Secretary's plan

280
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,886
to an unspecified future date?

281
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,884
Yeah, let's drop it.

282
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:37,730
Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, I'll go and attend to the plumbing.

283
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:45,415
- When's he going to leak it?
- Did I ask for a leak, Bernard?

284
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,693
- Well, not in so many... No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

285
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:54,768
I occasionally have confidential press briefings,
but I have never leaked.

286
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:59,133
Another irregular verb -
I give confidential press briefings, you leak,

287
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:04,085
he's been charged under Section 2A
of the Official Secrets Act.

288
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:12,007
- (ALL) Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Morning.

289
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:18,325
- (BOTH) Good morning.
- Have you seen the papers?

290
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:22,693
- Indeed.
- Dudley's replied to the press about that leak.

291
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,574
He's demanded a public inquiry.

292
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:30,570
- Shocking.
- Inquiries never find the true source of a leak.

293
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:36,091
- But we know the true source. You asked us...
- Bernard.

294
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:40,773
You're not suggesting I authorised this leak?

295
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:45,486
Er, no, I... er... That is, yes. Um, I mean...
Oh, I remember now. Sorry.

296
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:51,328
- What do you remember, Bernard?
- Whatever you want.

297
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:54,293
I want the public to know there are no divisions.

298
00:21:54,455 --> 00:21:57,811
- But there are.
- I don't want them multiplied.

299
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:01,411
If you multiply divisions,
you get back to where you started.

300
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,927
If you divide four by two, you get two.
If you multiply it, you get four.

301
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,814
Unless you multiply different divisions...

302
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:13,934
- Four by two... Bernard, send them in.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

303
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:19,611
I want to keep the Employment Secretary
in the Cabinet, and the Defence Secretary,

304
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,608
but I can't let this row go on any longer.

305
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:27,166
I can't allow the Employment Secretary
to be seen to defeat me. I can't risk it.

306
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:31,328
I suggest you ask the Committee
to agree to these three points.

307
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:34,089
First, they accept Cabinet's decision.

308
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:37,964
Secondly, there's a cooling-off period
with no further discussion.

309
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:43,846
Further, that all speeches and press statements
are cleared with the Cabinet Office.

310
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:49,135
Splendid. That should do it, yes.
Point one, a cooling-off period.

311
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:52,605
Point two, no more decisions or discussions...

312
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:55,209
No, what was the second one?

313
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,970
- I can't quite...
- I'll write it down for you, Prime Minister.

314
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:02,734
Ah, gentlemen, please be seated.

315
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:07,006
You've all had a copy of the agenda.

316
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:11,134
Item one, minutes of the last meeting.

317
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,684
Excuse me, a point of order.

318
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:18,133
My plan for defence establishment relocation
is not on the agenda.

319
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:20,490
- That is correct, Dudley.
- Why not?

320
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:26,446
This leaking is creating a damaging press row.
I can't allow the Cabinet to seem divided.

321
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,005
- It is divided.
- That's why it mustn't look it.

322
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:35,488
It's a very complex issue and I've decided
to defer further discussion until a later date.

323
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:39,045
- You were in favour of it last time.
- No, I wasn't.

324
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:44,050
- You were! So was everyone, except Defence.
- No, they weren't.

325
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:49,972
- They were! You promised further discussion!
- Um... I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think not.

326
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:53,127
- What?
- There was no such promise.

327
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:58,494
And the PM did not support the proposal.
If he had, it would appear in the minutes.

328
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:01,453
- It doesn't.
- Doesn't it?

329
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:06,484
Prime Minister, why was my request
for a further discussion not minuted?

330
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,453
- I...
- Er, Prime Minister.

331
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:16,691
It is characteristic of committee decisions that
every member has a vivid recollection of them

332
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,053
and that every member's recollection
differs from every other member's.

333
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:25,811
Consequently, we accept the convention
that official decisions are those

334
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,364
recorded in the minutes by the officials.

335
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,732
From which it emerges,
with an elegant inevitability,

336
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:36,286
that any officially reached decision
will have been recorded by the officials.

337
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:39,652
Any decision not recorded
has not been officially reached,

338
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,727
even if one or more members
believe they can recollect it,

339
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:46,205
so, in this case,
if the decision had been officially reached,

340
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,764
it would've been recorded by the officials,

341
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:50,926
and it isn't, so it wasn't.

342
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,486
Told you so.

343
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:59,044
This is a fiddle! Prime Minister...

344
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:01,365
- No, this must stop.
- Yes, it must!

345
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:05,733
I have drawn up a three-point plan
to which we must all adhere.

346
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:09,285
Point one... What was point one?

347
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:15,244
Oh, thank you. Point one, everyone
will accept collective decisions, Dudley.

348
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:19,613
- I am perfectly willing to. How are they defined?
- I define them.

349
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:25,846
Point two, there will be a cooling-off period
on defence relocations.

350
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:31,487
- Point three... Can't read this. Cleaning what?
- No, CLEARING all speeches...

351
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:36,046
All speeches and press statements
must be cleared with the Cabinet Office.

352
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:40,811
We can't cool off discussion on something
that hasn't been discussed yet

353
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:45,253
and I cannot accept that anything I say
must be cleared by HIM.

354
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:47,485
He won't clear what I want to say.

355
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:51,489
- That is my decision and you must accept it.
- I won't accept it!

356
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:53,968
(PRIME MINISTER) Oh.

357
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:00,084
Well, Dudley, I'm afraid you must
consider your position.

358
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:06,374
- Prime Minister.
- Yes?

359
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:10,767
I have news. Do you want the bad news first?

360
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:15,247
- There's bad news and good news?
- No, bad news and worse news.

361
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:18,612
The Employment Secretary has resigned.
His letter.

362
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:22,484
- I didn't want to lose him.
- Would you like the worse news now?

363
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:27,410
He's accused you of being dictatorial
and running a presidential-style government.

364
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,684
Oh. Well, I don't mind that.

365
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:35,973
Rather good, isn't it?
People like to know they've got a strong leader.

366
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:39,172
- Dictatorial, eh?
- It will be a new pleasure for them.

367
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,724
- No, it won't.
- No, it won't.

368
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:46,286
Humphrey, I'm upset about this resignation.
YOUR three-point plan provoked it.

369
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:49,288
Yes, indeed, Prime Minister, but I understand

370
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:53,653
the Employment Secretary was planning
to resign soon in any case.

371
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:56,010
Was he? Why? And when?

372
00:26:56,175 --> 00:27:01,932
On budget day, as it was expected to give him
insufficient money to deal with unemployment.

373
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:05,087
- Damaging.
- It would've made him extremely popular.

374
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:10,454
- Perhaps it's as well I made him go.
- Prime Minister, you handled it brilliantly!

375
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:15,211
You forced him to resign on an obscure
administrative issue of your choosing,

376
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,367
rather than on a policy issue of his choosing.

377
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:23,290
Nobody will support him because nobody will
understand why he's gone. A masterstroke!

378
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,253
Yes... it was pretty clever, wasn't it?

379
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,451
Oh, masterly!

380
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:31,607
Here's a press statement you might release.

381
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,973
- Shall I phone Bill?
- No, Bernard, I shall phone Bill.

382
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:38,126
Dictatorial, hm?

383
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:43,723
I didn't know he was thinking of resigning
over the budget.

384
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,490
- Nor did I.
- You mean it's not true?

385
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:52,046
I didn't say it was true.
I said I understood it to be true.

386
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:56,003
- I may have misunderstood.
- So you don't know it's true?

387
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,565
- I don't know it's not. It might be.
- Anything might be!

388
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:03,205
Exactly. Well done, Bernard.

389
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,366
Take this down, Bill.

390
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:11,724
"I'm puzzled because his plan was being studied,
but there was a danger of much greater cost

391
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:16,491
"without necessarily achieving
the employment objectives."

392
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,647
Fine. Send it up to me when it's typed.

393
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,805
Well, Humphrey,
looks as if you've done me a good turn.

394
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:27,570
- Yes, indeed, Prime Minister.
- Pity, though.

395
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:31,774
Yes. But he was plotting against you,
you said so yourself.

396
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,813
Yes. Hold on, I've got an idea!

397
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:36,772
Prime Minister!

398
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:42,327
Now that the Employment Secretary's gone,
we could reinstate the plan!

399
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,172
But...

400
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:49,931
I could press on with it now
and it won't look like weakness, but strength!

401
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:53,087
- But the whole point was...
- Was what?

402
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:57,726
- It wasn't to stop the plan, surely?
- No, no, no, no, no.

403
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:01,365
It was to... um... um... er... er...

404
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:04,925
...establish your authority.
- Exactly. And I've done that.

405
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:08,292
So, if we recreate the plan,
it'll show I wasn't against it

406
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,448
and that Dudley's resignation
was pointless, right?

407
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:17,006
Put it top of the agenda
for the next Cabinet... OK?

408
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:21,044
Yes, Prime Minister.
