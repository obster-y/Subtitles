1
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,373
Do you think perhaps...

2
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:49,767
I mean, would it have been wiser,
you know, with hindsight...

3
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:51,971
- Was it a mistake...
- Yes, Bernard?

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,686
- You didn't have to agree to present the awards.
- Bill recommended it. Didn't you?

5
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,244
I didn't actually recommend it.

6
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,885
I just said the British theatre awards dinner
was televised live

7
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:08,049
and, as guest of honour, you'd be seen by
12 million people in a context of glamour and fun

8
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:12,606
and you'd be associated with actors
and actresses who give pleasure to millions.

9
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:17,166
- That's not a recommendation?
- Isn't it a bad idea to be associated with actors?

10
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:22,489
Their job is pretending to be what they're not.
If you're seen with them, people might realise.

11
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,764
- Go on, Bernard.
- Well, I... I mean, er, not realise...

12
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,689
...might suspect... might think that you were, er...

13
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:34,653
Not that you were pretending, er... entertaining...

14
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:39,650
- What was it you wanted to speak to Bill about?
- You said this wouldn't be controversial.

15
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:44,525
No other politicians are there. Actors and
actresses are usually nice to politicians.

16
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,607
They dish out flattery as eagerly as they lap it up.

17
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,209
- Do they?
- Sometimes.

18
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,570
- What about this?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:57,855
We didn't know how small the Arts Council grant
would be when we accepted the invitation.

20
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,734
You knew we were being criticised over the arts.

21
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:04,649
All governments are always criticised
for not giving enough to the arts.

22
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:08,125
It's how arts journalists
suck up to actors and producers.

23
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,844
That's how they get back on speaking terms
after giving bad reviews.

24
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:17,169
- And the grant was only finalised yesterday.
- Almost no increase for the National Theatre.

25
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:21,647
Its managing director will make a speech
introducing me at the dinner.

26
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:25,205
- Yes.
- Snide remarks, sarcastic jokes.

27
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,765
Attacking me for my meanness.
The philistine at No.10.

28
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:32,166
Live in front of 12 million people.

29
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,565
Yes, but Bill didn't know.

30
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:39,809
What about when I speak? A hostile audience.
Do you think there'll be boos?

31
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,967
Bound to be and we don't have to pay for it.

32
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:46,286
Not booze, Bernard, I mean boos. Boo! Ssss!

33
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:53,013
Send the Arts Minister along instead, so they can
all blame him. That's what junior ministers are for.

34
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:57,646
I can see the headlines. "Jim chickens out.
PM runs away from his critics."

35
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,966
If there was a major crisis,
you wouldn't need to go.

36
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:05,333
- Is there a major crisis coming up?
- Not really, Prime Minister.

37
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:09,488
Is there a distant crisis
that we could bring forward?

38
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:13,726
What sort of crisis would justify cancellation?

39
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:18,605
Pound plunges, small war in the South Atlantic,
nuclear power station catches fire.

40
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,733
I don't think any of those things
would improve my image.

41
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:26,650
It'd justify you staying away. I know!
What about the death of a Cabinet colleague?

42
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:30,728
Ooh. Is one imminent?

43
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:35,286
Er, no, but that would justify your absence
without damaging your image.

44
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:39,812
We can hardly hope for that
to fall on the right day. Well, not by accident.

45
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:43,653
- I need help.
- You do!

46
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:47,728
- You do?
- Got to make a speech. It could be embarrassing.

47
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:53,925
Prime Minister, your speeches are nothing like
as embarrassing as they used to be. In fact...

48
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:58,088
- Not the speech, Humphrey, the occasion.
- Ah, yes, indeed. Why?

49
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:02,294
It's to be to a hostile audience
of posturing, theatrical drunks.

50
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,652
- The House of Commons, you mean?
- No, Humphrey.

51
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:10,843
The annual awards dinner of the British theatre.
I'm to be their guest of honour.

52
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:15,008
You're worried that they won't honour their guest
in view of the small grant.

53
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,770
It's difficult to influence
the National Theatre's managing director.

54
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:22,132
- I'm on the board of governors.
- Are you indeed?

55
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,083
Perhaps you can tell me,
how do I make them feel that I'm one of them?

56
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:30,646
Well, surely you don't want them to see you
as a posturing, theatrical drunk.

57
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,931
Perhaps they do already.

58
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:37,775
It's on TV. I don't want a hostile reception.

59
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:42,133
With respect, Prime Minister,
if one is going to walk into the lion's den,

60
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,889
one should not take away the lion's dinner.

61
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:49,048
- So what's your advice?
- Give them more dinner.

62
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:52,685
Increase the grant to the Arts Council.
Only two million or so.

63
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:57,133
- It'd make it a fairly expensive dinner.
- Well, it is the Grosvenor.

64
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:01,891
As a governor of that subversive body,
you have a vested interest, don't you?

65
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,523
- In fact, a conflict of interests.
- How so?

66
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:09,894
That bloody place puts on plays attacking me.
They set "The Comedy of Errors" in No.10.

67
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:14,048
- Oh, Prime...
- Don't deny it. I know who they were getting at.

68
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:17,173
And a play attacked my nuclear policy. A farce.

69
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:20,054
- The policy?
- No, Humphrey, the play.

70
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:24,650
- Why do they do it?
- Well, it's very healthy, Prime Minister.

71
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,407
- Healthy?
- Yes.

72
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:31,171
Practically nobody goes to political plays
and half that do don't understand them,

73
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:33,769
and half that understand them don't agree,

74
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:37,974
and the seven left would've voted
against the government anyway.

75
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:40,330
It helps people let off steam

76
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:44,886
and you are seen as a democratic statesman
for subsidising your critics.

77
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,410
People who want to criticise me
should pay at the box office!

78
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,772
Oh, Prime Minister,
they'd never make enough money.

79
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,850
Plays criticising the government make
the second most boring evenings ever invented.

80
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,654
They insult... What are the most boring?

81
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,568
Plays praising the government.

82
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:07,729
- They insult me and then expect more money?
- Yes, it is a rather undignified posture.

83
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:12,332
Artists always crawl towards the government
on their knees, shaking their fists.

84
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:16,204
- Beating me over the head with begging bowls.
- Sorry to be pedantic.

85
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:22,291
They can't beat you over the head if they're
on their knees unless they've got very long arms.

86
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:25,128
- Get off the floor.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

87
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:30,210
- There are no votes in giving money to the arts.
- But terrible publicity if you take it away.

88
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,607
The arts lobby is middle class.
It's one of the few ways they get their tax back.

89
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:39,371
Mortgage tax relief, university grants,
lump-sum pensions, Radio 3,

90
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,527
and subsidised seats at the theatre,
opera and concerts.

91
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,686
You can't begrudge it us.

92
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,652
Them.

93
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:52,128
People can spend their own money. Why should
government money be spent on pleasure?

94
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,891
Nobody could call it pleasure. The point is,
we have a great heritage to support.

95
00:06:57,055 --> 00:07:02,254
Pictures no one wants to see, music no one
wants to hear, plays no one wants to watch.

96
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:07,011
You can't let them die
just because nobody's interested.

97
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:11,168
- Why not?
- Well, it's a bit like the Church of England.

98
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:15,726
People don't go to church,
but they feel better because it's there.

99
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,931
The arts are just the same.

100
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:22,566
As long as they're going on,
you can feel part of a civilised nation.

101
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,727
There are no votes in the arts.
Nobody's interested.

102
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:29,604
Nobody's interested
in the Social Science Research Council

103
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:34,974
or the Dumping at Sea Representation Panel,
but government still pays to support them.

104
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,332
- They do some good.
- They don't, Prime Minister.

105
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,328
They hardly do anything at all.

106
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,488
- Well, let's abolish them!
- No, no, no, no!

107
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:51,207
They are symbols. You don't fund them
for doing work but to show what you approve of.

108
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,971
Most government expenditure is symbolic.
The Arts Council is a symbol.

109
00:07:56,135 --> 00:08:00,890
- You're getting off the point.
- I'm sorry, Prime Minister. What was the point?

110
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,090
What was the point, Bernard?

111
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,484
Er, the point of what?

112
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:12,570
Oh, how to stop the managing director of
the National Theatre criticising you in his speech.

113
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:15,329
I suggest you have a quiet word with him.

114
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,647
Say the knighthood that usually goes
with the job is within the gift of the PM.

115
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,693
He said he couldn't care less about a knighthood.

116
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:27,485
Huh! Everybody says that about knighthoods
until they're dangled in front of them.

117
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:31,084
Don't they, Sir Humphrey?

118
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:37,449
He talked about your putting on plays
attacking him.

119
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,925
Did you point out
no one's ever submitted a play defending him?

120
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,928
Well, I'm not sure that would've helped.

121
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:48,088
What about next year's Arts Council grant?
Will they get the extra 30 million?

122
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:51,850
My dear Simon,
I couldn't disclose the figure in advance,

123
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,813
least of all to the MD of the National Theatre.

124
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,010
Have some of these.

125
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,013
Excuse me.

126
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,769
Only six? You're not serious?

127
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:20,245
That's the new diet.
Six breadsticks is the absolute maximum.

128
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:23,248
Is that gross breadsticks or net breadsticks?

129
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,966
- Net breadsticks.
- So what'll we get at the National?

130
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,490
- Only one?
- Shh, shh, shh.

131
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,846
How can we manage
on one and half million pounds?

132
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:49,363
- I don't know where you got that figure from.
- Look, you've got to help me. What can I do?

133
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:55,132
You mean, if the grant figure,
which of course we do not yet know,

134
00:09:55,295 --> 00:10:00,323
were to be not just less than you told the press
was the absolute minimum to stave off disaster

135
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,805
but lower than the REAL minimum required
to stave off disaster?

136
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,853
- Yes.
- I can't help you, even though I'm on the board.

137
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:12,214
Let me be quite clear about this, Simon.
I am here to represent the PM's interests.

138
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,572
There are certain things
which would gravely upset him.

139
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:19,489
I must urge you, on his behalf,
not to contemplate them.

140
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,445
Good. What are they?

141
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:26,324
You'll be making the speech
introducing him at the awards dinner.

142
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,532
It would be a courtesy to send a draft to No.10
in advance.

143
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,892
- For approval?
- Well, let's say for information.

144
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,853
Now, the Prime Minister is extremely anxious

145
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:39,724
that the speech should not refer
to the modesty of the grant increase.

146
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:42,728
There are certain words he'd like you to avoid.

147
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:45,728
Miserly... philistine...

148
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:50,645
...barbarism... skinflint...

149
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,532
...killjoy.

150
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:59,845
He'd also like you to avoid all reference to
how much more other countries spend on the arts.

151
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:03,007
- What are the figures?
- Here you are.

152
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,774
To make sure you don't mention them by mistake.

153
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,329
I certainly won't mention them by mistake.

154
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,293
And thirdly, and most important of all,

155
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:17,653
he wants no comparison between
the extra money your theatre needs

156
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:22,411
and certain sums that the government
spent last year on certain projects.

157
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:28,252
- Such as?
- Well, let's say the figure were to be four million.

158
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,724
Purely as an example, of course.

159
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:34,092
The PM earnestly hopes that your speech

160
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:38,453
will not refer to the fact
that the government spent five million

161
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:43,166
on radar equipment for a fighter plane
that had already been scrapped.

162
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,289
Or that the Department of Energy had been able

163
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:52,768
to stockpile a thousand years' supply
of filing tabs.

164
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:58,453
Or that another department
had stocked up with a million tins of Vim.

165
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,090
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

166
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,328
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much. That was delicious.

167
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:12,446
- He never even goes to the theatre, does he?
- Well, he can't, really.

168
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:18,326
He's frightened of giving the cartoonists
and gossip columnists too much ammunition.

169
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:23,888
He couldn't go to "A Month In The Country" for
fear of starting rumours about a general election.

170
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:27,047
And he couldn't go to your production
of "The Rivals"

171
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,207
because so many ministers were after his job.

172
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,173
He couldn't go to "The School For Scandal".

173
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,725
Well, not after the Education Secretary

174
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:41,571
had been found in bed
with that married primary-school headmistress.

175
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:45,330
- I see.
- And then there was that play by Ibsen.

176
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,293
- Oh, dear, what's it...
- "The Master Builder"?

177
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,252
Hardly.

178
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:53,646
I was thinking of "An Enemy Of The People".

179
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,806
Say no more.

180
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:04,690
(ANNOUNCER) Sir William and Lady Langthorne.

181
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:07,608
Mr and Mrs Simon Monk.

182
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:15,126
- No, no, it's me.
- Oh, sorry.

183
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,889
- I think that's the lot.
- We can stand down?

184
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,853
- Yes, Mrs Hacker.
- Thank goodness for that!

185
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:25,611
Nice you're taking such trouble over theatre
people, even though they're not important.

186
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:28,573
- They're extremely important.
- In what way?

187
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,454
Showbiz people have a hotline to the media.

188
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:35,324
If you're on "EastEnders",
the press want your opinion on everything.

189
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,487
- Why?
- Editors like to sell their papers.

190
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:42,694
Start an article with a picture of Dirty Den,
everybody wants to read it.

191
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:47,929
Start one with a picture of the Trade and
Industry Secretary, nobody wants to read it.

192
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,724
They all turn into supporters
after a few glasses of warm sherry?

193
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:56,685
Some do. That's why we dish out a couple
of OBEs and a knighthood every New Year.

194
00:13:56,855 --> 00:14:02,009
Keeps them hoping. Stops them attacking the
government the next time they're on "Wogan".

195
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,169
Prime Minister, the Arts Minister's
rather anxious to have a word with you.

196
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:11,408
There's going to be trouble
when they find out how small the grant is.

197
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:14,692
We'll just have to brazen it out. Won't you?

198
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:20,493
- I think we'll have to try to find a bit more.
- We've been through all this.

199
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:24,648
- The theatre brings in tourists.
- Let the Tourist Board subsidise them.

200
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,613
They say they've better ways of attracting them.

201
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:32,326
We're subsidising bad ways of attracting tourists?
No, we've spent enough on the arts.

202
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:36,932
We'd have to spend it anyway.
It's a concealed way of preserving old buildings.

203
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:41,885
- How do you mean?
- All these theatres, art galleries and museums

204
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:46,128
are listed buildings we'd have to maintain,
and they're totally useless.

205
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:51,289
So we put in central heating and a caretaker
to make it look as if we're preserving the arts.

206
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:55,368
- Let's sell them.
- We can't. They're ancient monuments.

207
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,526
Hm, like the Cabinet.

208
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,691
Mind you, I'd sell THEM if I could.

209
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:06,885
Isn't it better to wait until the figure is published?
If I try to lobby him now, he won't say anything.

210
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:09,444
But you want him to DO something.

211
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,812
- But if I wait...
- Then the figure will be published.

212
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:17,571
Everyone will be committed to it
and they'll have to stick with it to save face.

213
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:22,286
To change government decisions,
do it before anybody knows they're being made.

214
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:27,290
- Isn't that rather difficult?
- Yes. That's what the Civil Service is for.

215
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:31,926
- To change government decisions?
- Well, only the bad ones.

216
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,892
That's most of them, of course.

217
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:38,609
- Do you really believe in the British theatre?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

218
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:42,893
- Why?
- Well, it's one of the great glories of England.

219
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:46,889
- You mean Shakespeare?
- Shakespeare, yes, absolutely.

220
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,853
- Who else?
- Who... er...

221
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,927
Well... there's Shakespeare, of course,

222
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:57,293
and... er... Sheridan, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Shaw.

223
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:02,404
- They were all Irish.
- Well, Irish, English. Same thing then, wasn't it?

224
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,965
- Bernard Shaw died in 1950.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

225
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:13,126
- Do you go to the theatre a lot?
- I'd love to, but you know how it is in my job.

226
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,804
Shouldn't the PM go,
if it's one of the great glories of England?

227
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,763
- Well, the Arts Minister goes. Part of his job.
- (MAN) Why?

228
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:25,531
- The PM can't do everything. Have to delegate.
- Going to the theatre is work?

229
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:29,404
Well, wouldn't like to trespass
on another minister's territory.

230
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:33,045
You can't feel ill
without clearing it with the Health Minister?

231
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,652
Not exactly.

232
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:41,246
- But what about when you were in opposition?
- It was much the same.

233
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:46,569
So when you say you believe in the theatre,
it's like believing in God. You believe it exists.

234
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:49,249
No, no, I'm a great supporter.

235
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:52,213
What was the last play you went to?

236
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,172
Last pl... er...

237
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,649
- I think it'd be "Hamlet".
- Whose?

238
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,652
Shakespeare's.

239
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,609
- Do you know who played Hamlet?
- Oh... er...

240
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,766
Henry Irving?

241
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:14,725
- Er, Sir Humphrey, could I have a word?
- Of course. Forgive me, Mrs Hacker.

242
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,932
Sir Humphrey,
I don't think the PM's enjoying himself.

243
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:23,088
He's not supposed to. Cocktail parties at No.10
are just a gruesome duty.

244
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,850
- People keep asking him questions.
- He should be used to that.

245
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,734
They weren't tabled in advance,
so he isn't briefed.

246
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:33,934
- He's not on the record.
- Yes, but people will think he's a philistine.

247
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,892
Good heavens!

248
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:41,007
- I was wondering, should we go and rescue him?
- All right, leave it to me.

249
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:44,884
We'll do what we can,
but there are many calls on the public purse.

250
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:48,650
- Inner cities, hospitals, kidney machines.
- Tanks.

251
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:50,646
- Rockets.
- H-bombs.

252
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:55,013
We can't defend ourselves against the Russians
with a performance of "Henry V".

253
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,928
Prime Minister. I'm so sorry, ladies.

254
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:02,604
- This isn't a drinks party, it's a siege.
- I was about to suggest

255
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:06,370
that you should talk to
the National Theatre's managing director.

256
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,730
- You want me to face another salvo?
- No.

257
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:12,490
I've tried to persuade him
to make the right sort of speech.

258
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:16,091
- Have you? Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

259
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:19,486
But you might have more success. Simon Monk.

260
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:22,249
- Ah, Mr Monk.
- Prime Minister.

261
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:26,203
- So you're going to introduce me at this dinner?
- That's right.

262
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,367
Any idea what you're... going to say?

263
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:33,494
Well... um... I suppose it depends, really.

264
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,648
Yes, yes... On...?

265
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:42,252
- On the size of the grant, I suppose.
- Of course, that's still under discussion.

266
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:45,612
Of course, but if it were to be generous,

267
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,768
I could talk about the way this government
has got its priorities right,

268
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,813
believing in Britain's heritage, what it stands for.

269
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:56,729
Terrific, terrific. Of course, if I can't...

270
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,604
That is, if the Arts Minister
can't cough up as much as you'd hoped.

271
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,972
Ah, well, that would be... rather difficult.

272
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:08,128
- You wouldn't want to make it political.
- Not for myself, of course not.

273
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:12,049
But my colleagues would expect me
to voice their feelings.

274
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:16,970
There are many calls on the public purse.
Inner cities, hospitals, kidney machines.

275
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:21,925
Yes. I thought perhaps the best way round it
would be to make it funny.

276
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,290
- Funny?
- Yes.

277
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:28,243
List ways the government spends the money
it can't afford for the arts.

278
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:31,612
Did you know that in one year
one London borough

279
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:36,565
spent ? million on hotels for families
when it had 4,000 empty council houses?

280
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,203
Isn't that hilarious?

281
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,971
- Of course, local government.
- Yes, yes, but it is all government, isn't it?

282
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,729
The taxpayer pays the Rate Support Grant.

283
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:53,084
And did you know that another council spends
?00 a week on a toenail-cutting administrator?

284
00:19:53,895 --> 00:20:00,289
One city was employing four gas-lamp lighters
eight years after the last gas lamp was removed.

285
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,173
That cost a quarter of a million.
Should get a good laugh.

286
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:07,812
Not to mention the council that spent ?30

287
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,887
having two square yards of shrubbery weeded.

288
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:16,652
And the government office block scheduled for
demolition two weeks before it was completed.

289
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:22,128
That should go down rather well at the dinner
and make jolly good TV, don't you agree?

290
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:27,085
- So nice to meet you.
- I just hope you realise, Prime Minister,

291
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:31,453
that unless we get a substantial rise,
the National Theatre will collapse

292
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,005
and there'll be a huge empty building
on the South Bank,

293
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:39,134
a decaying monument
to this government's barbarism.

294
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:46,252
Where did he get those examples
of government waste?

295
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,804
I really can't imagine.

296
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,293
- The National Theatre may call my bluff.
- What is your bluff?

297
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:57,652
- That I'm willing to risk their bluff.
- What's their bluff?

298
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:01,364
- Their bluff is they think I'm bluffing, whereas...
- You are.

299
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:05,325
I don't know now.

300
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:09,807
- You mean you're playing blind man's bluff.
- May I just clarify this?

301
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:12,967
You think the National Theatre
thinks you are bluffing.

302
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:15,444
They think you think THEY are bluffing,

303
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:19,449
whereas your bluff is to make them think
you are bluffing when you're not.

304
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:22,812
If you are,
your bluff is to make them think you're not.

305
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:28,049
Their bluff must be that they're bluffing because
if they're not bluffing, they're not bluffing.

306
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:32,128
Thank you, Bernard. An invaluable contribution.

307
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:36,891
What is your policy? Will you risk their refusing
to continue if you don't increase the grant?

308
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:42,254
I shall just have to go on re-stating my policy,
I think, until... until...

309
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,248
Until you know what it is.

310
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,407
Dorothy, you've got to help me.
This is a hot potato.

311
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,692
If I don't do anything,
it could turn into a banana skin.

312
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:55,643
- A hot potato can't become a banana skin.
- What?

313
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,603
If you don't do anything,
a hot potato just becomes a cold potato.

314
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:03,131
May I make a suggestion? I have a plan.

315
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,889
- A plan? Yes, good. What?
- Call their bluff.

316
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:11,652
Sell the National Theatre building. It's a prime site.
It's on the South Bank overlooking St Paul's.

317
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:14,613
- Sell it? To whom?
- To a property developer.

318
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:19,644
- We'd get ?0- or ?0 million for it.
- But we wouldn't have a National Theatre!

319
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:23,524
We'd have sold the building, not the company.

320
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:29,804
The National Theatre gets ? million a year.
Nearly half goes on the upkeep of the buildings.

321
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:35,049
That could go into productions by all
the subsidised companies all over the country.

322
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:39,413
Monk said he didn't think they ought
to have to spend their grant in that way.

323
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:43,727
He said the theatre should be about plays,
not about bricks and mortar.

324
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:49,606
- Where would they put on their plays?
- There are plenty of theatres all over the country.

325
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:54,246
- They could rent them like any other producer.
- Dorothy, this is brilliant!

326
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,169
The theatre's about plays and actors,
not maintaining buildings.

327
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,293
And it'd make the company genuinely national.

328
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:05,164
And we could give the ? million
to put on their productions.

329
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:09,533
The government would still make a net profit
of over ?0 million!

330
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:12,163
Nobody could call me a philistine then!

331
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,974
Not unless they knew you.

332
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:22,891
- Prime Minister, you remember Simon Monk?
- Ah, Mr Monk, yes.

333
00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:27,253
- This is very bad news about the grant.
- Surely not. It's gone up.

334
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:31,203
- Nothing like enough.
- Enough for it to be unnecessary for you to...?

335
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,843
- I'm afraid not.
- Oh.

336
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:37,690
I was hoping to do something
really significant next year.

337
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:42,087
You said you had to spend
nearly half your grant on upkeep.

338
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:46,453
- I have a plan to relieve you of that.
- Really? That would be marvellous.

339
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:50,403
Wouldn't it? And it'd make the National Theatre
really national.

340
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:55,569
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking of selling the National Theatre.

341
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,932
- Selling it?
- I knew you'd be pleased.

342
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,848
- That way we can save ? million on upkeep.
- This is impossible!

343
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:07,007
No, it's easy.
We've had a terrific offer for the site.

344
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:10,372
- The National Theatre must have a base.
- And it will.

345
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:16,007
You could have inexpensive offices
in Brixton or Toxteth... or Middlesbrough.

346
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:19,854
What about the theatres, the workshops?

347
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:26,170
You could hire them. Put on productions in the
West End or the Old Vic or provincial theatres.

348
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:28,644
Become strolling players again

349
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:32,888
- instead of... civil servants.
- But that would be disastrous!

350
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:37,048
Surely not. Didn't you say the theatre
wasn't about bricks and mortar?

351
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:42,289
Yes, yes, but that was...
Look, the National Theatre must have a home!

352
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:45,652
And so it will. Lots of homes.

353
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:49,410
All the subsidised theatres
would be called national theatres.

354
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:55,525
There'd be the National Theatre at Glasgow,
at Sheffield, at Bristol, and so on.

355
00:24:55,695 --> 00:25:01,292
And that three million can help them all. You'd
be the London branch of the National Theatre.

356
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:05,130
- That'd be popular with the whole profession.
- Barbarism!

357
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,573
- Spending money on actors instead of buildings?
- Yes. Well, no, no...

358
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:12,932
- Um...
- Anyway, it's just one of my options.

359
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,292
I may decide against it... or I may not.

360
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:21,047
I could outline it in my speech... if necessary.

361
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:25,763
- It all depends.
- On...?

362
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:30,805
Have you decided what you'll say
in your speech yet?

363
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,772
Yes.

364
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,405
Oh... er... well... not finally.

365
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:41,365
I wondered if those jokes about
government waste were really very funny.

366
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,095
Of course, it's your decision.

367
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:46,246
I'm sure you understand me.

368
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,807
(GAVEL BANGED THREE TIMES)

369
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:58,933
Mr Prime Minister, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen,

370
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:05,125
pray silence for Simon Monk, Esquire,
the managing director of the National Theatre.

371
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:12,405
Mr Prime Minster, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen...

372
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:24,325
You will have read of the grant
for the Arts Council and the National Theatre.

373
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:29,694
I know many of us are... disappointed
by the amount.

374
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:36,885
We'd have all liked it to have been larger,
but this is a time of national stringency

375
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,047
and we must think in terms of national needs.

376
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,934
There are many calls on the public purse.

377
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:49,011
Education, inner cities, health...
kidney machines.

378
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:56,814
We should be glad that any increase has been
possible and grateful to our guest of honour

379
00:26:56,975 --> 00:27:02,368
whose personal intervention made even
this small breadstick possible... er, increase.

380
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:11,287
Ladies and gentlemen, to our guest of honour,
the patron of the arts, the Prime Minister.

381
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:16,927
- My lords, ladies and gentlemen, the toast is...
- Excellent speech, don't you think, Humphrey?

382
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:21,168
...the patron of the arts, the Prime Minister.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

383
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:24,054
(ALL) The Prime Minister.
