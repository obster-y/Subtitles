1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,140
Gentlemen, we're here to consider
security clearance

2
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,132
for the publication of my predecessor's memoirs.

3
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,088
- Solicitor General.
- We've already approved chapters 1 to 7.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,449
- I see no reason to withhold approval for 8.
- There is some highly questionable material.

5
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,612
- Such as?
- Well, page 211, for a start.

6
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,009
It only says, "The Administrative Affairs Minister
supported the expansion of Sellafield in Cabinet,

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,776
- "but spoke out against it in public."
- That was me. I was the minister.

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,933
- The point is it's not a security leak.
- But it isn't true.

9
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,298
The documentation is fairly impressive,
but with respect,

10
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,329
if he's libelled you, it's a matter for the courts,
not for the Security Clearance Committee.

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,210
We can't have such accusations spread around.
It's not just page 211 either.

12
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,579
On 224, there's a scurrilous accusation
about my stopping that chemical-plant project

13
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,334
because of a baseless press scare.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,890
Then there's an indefensible passage
about me on page 231.

15
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,656
Oh, 231. "Hacker was more interested in votes
than principles,

16
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,610
"running for cover at the first whiff
of unpopularity.

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,171
"He raised the average age of Cabinet
but lowered the average IQ."

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,014
Thank you, Humphrey. We've all read the chapter.

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,777
As I said, I'm not supporting or defending him,
but it's not an actual security breach.

20
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,738
Chapter 5 got leaked and we took no action.

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,258
Oh, well, chapter 5 was very complimentary
about my getting the Kumran contract.

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,618
It had as much confidential material
and you never had a leak inquiry.

23
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,490
Well... anybody could have leaked
that chapter to the press.

24
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,411
Anybody.

25
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,653
- I mean, even the title of chapter 8...
- "The Two Faces Of Jim Hacker."

26
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,015
Er, that's not a secret, surely.

27
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,449
I think there are security implications.
Sellafield is nuclear.

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,057
The Energy Secretary has seen the chapter
and he says he has no problems.

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,169
No! It describes him as the ablest minister
in Cabinet. Another slur on me.

30
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,934
- It isn't actionable.
- Let's be clear.

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,297
- We have the right to refuse publication.
- We have.

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,056
If they publish anyway, we'll have no hope
of stopping it through the courts.

33
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,018
- Lean on the publishers.
- On what grounds?

34
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,489
- National interest.
- I've already...

35
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,859
It's obscene filth. It cannot be in the national
interest to ridicule the national leader.

36
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,219
I mean... undermine confidence
in the national leadership.

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,133
Chapter 8 must not be published, right?

38
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,338
- Well, Bernard?
- No, not very, Sir Humphrey.

39
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,371
Has the PM seen that yet?

40
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,897
They quoted it on "Today".
He'd have listened to it while he had breakfast.

41
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,654
I heard it. They had HIM for breakfast.

42
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,699
They had fun with, "Jim Hacker raised
the average age of the Cabinet...

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,011
(BOTH) "...but lowered the average IQ."

44
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,652
- Actually, it is rather amusing.
- Yes, it is. But, er, on the other hand...

45
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,210
I know.
Have you any explanation for this leak?

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,338
- It wasn't me.
- Of course it wasn't you!

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,970
It's hardly in your interest or mine
to leak THAT chapter.

48
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,849
It's not just chapter 8,
it's the report that he tried to suppress it.

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,808
- The leak came from someone at the meeting.
- Good morning.

50
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,371
- What makes him think that?
- Is he... er...? Has he...

51
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,373
Half of Britain's press corps are here
waiting for his response.

52
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,293
- Only half?
- The other half are on the phone.

53
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,451
The foreign press have picked it up.

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,090
I've had interview requests from "Le Monde",
the "Washington Post",

55
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,058
and "Women's Wear Daily".

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,054
- How do you think he'll take it?
- (INTERCOM BUZZER)

57
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,688
We're just about to find out.

58
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,330
(IMPATIENT CONTINUOUS BUZZING)

59
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,372
Well?

60
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,412
Well? Well, say something.

61
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,211
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

62
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,532
Seen this? You're my press secretary, Bill.
It's a catastrophe!

63
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,692
- With respect...
- With no respect at all!

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,457
No respect for confidentiality, no respect
for the national interest or the national leader!

65
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,054
- Who leaked it?
- Who can say?

66
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,691
You can say and you'd better say!
I want this traced at once!

67
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,648
- It must've been somebody at the meeting.
- I'll set up a leak inquiry.

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,608
I don't want a leak inquiry.
I want to find out who did it.

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,408
One normally doesn't want to find out
who's responsible

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,299
in case it turns out to be one of the Cabinet.

71
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,170
The Solicitor General and I were the only
ministers present. Law officers never leak.

72
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,049
He had nothing to gain,
it wasn't me and all the rest were officials.

73
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,816
- I will pursue this through to the courts!
- The press are all waiting.

74
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,450
There are four requests for TV interviews
and eleven for radio.

75
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,093
Marvellous. Last week, I was dying to tell them
about my achieving detente with the Soviets.

76
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,139
Now this happens
and they charge in like a herd of vultures.

77
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,609
Not herd, Prime Minister.

78
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,334
(CLEARLY) Charge in like a herd...

79
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,889
Vultures don't herd, they flock.

80
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,014
And they don't charge, they... er...

81
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,897
- What do they do, Bernard?
- They... er...

82
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,571
Sit down, Bernard.

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,209
Why can't the press support Britain?

84
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,214
Why do they muck-rake?
Why can't they write about our successes?

85
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,612
- Like... er...?
- Well, like my detente with the Soviets.

86
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,934
There are friendly noises from the Kremlin,
but it hasn't led to anything concrete.

87
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,489
- It's going to.
- I'm sorry.

88
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,132
I have to tell them something about you trying
to suppress your predecessor's memoirs.

89
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,498
Very well. Talk to them off the record.
"Sources close to the Prime Minister."

90
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,855
- Say nothing attributable.
- Right.

91
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,410
Say that what he said about me
is a pack of lies.

92
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,131
Um... you mean about... er... running for cover
and that sort of thing?

93
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,177
- Yes.
- The problem is, it is the author's opinion.

94
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,649
We can't call him a liar for an opinion.

95
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,496
Well, say that it's a pack of lies
about my supporting Sellafield in Cabinet

96
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,651
but speaking against it in public.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,608
- Er, yes, but the thing is, it is sort of true.
- Oh, shut up, Bernard.

98
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,930
How do we say it's a pack of lies?

99
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,410
The PM's recollection is at variance
with his predecessor's.

100
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,890
Then say the Cabinet minutes
vindicate me completely,

101
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,249
but, unfortunately, owing to the 30-year rule,
they can't be disclosed for another 25 years,

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,856
which makes his book deeply unfair
as well as untrue.

103
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,808
- What about the smears against you personally?
- Smear him.

104
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,976
Say that he's trying to re-write history to make
his own premiership look a little less disastrous.

105
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,450
- Imply that he's going gaga.
- Fine.

106
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,648
"Passage of time and separation from official
records have perhaps clouded his memory."

107
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,417
- Yeah. What about the gaga bit?
- "One would expect it from a man of his age."

108
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,048
- That do?
- That's OK for the chapter.

109
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,010
- What about your trying to prevent publication?
- Say that's a pack of lies, too.

110
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,889
"Garbled account of a routine meeting.
No question of suppression."

111
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,858
- Do you want to give interviews?
- No.

112
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,012
- Shall I say why?
- Make it a quote.

113
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,050
"Insignificant matter of no national importance.
Typical of the media's trivialisation of politics."

114
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,010
- And who shall I attribute that quote to?
- Close Cabinet colleague.

115
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,811
Thank you, Prime Minister.

116
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,094
- This is a disaster.
- Oh, surely it's not all that serious.

117
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,889
Telling the public
they can't trust their Prime Minister?

118
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,370
They won't believe that.

119
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,577
- Think not?
- Of course not.

120
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,369
They might. Or they couldn't trust
their ex-Prime Minister.

121
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,850
- Yes, thank you.
- They never could trust him.

122
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,012
Thank goodness I've brought back honesty.

123
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,253
- Thank goodness, Prime Minister.
- Now, about nailing that leak.

124
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,049
Sorry to be pedantic,
but if you nail a leak, you make another.

125
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,575
I want to trace the culprit
and I want a prosecution.

126
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,130
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- And I want a conviction.

127
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,895
We can try and trace the culprit,
we can prosecute,

128
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,051
but under our political system,

129
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,930
there are problems about the government
actually guaranteeing a conviction.

130
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,297
Oh, surely. Little drinkie with the judge?

131
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,818
Unthinkable. There is no way any pressure
can be placed on a judge.

132
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,735
- How does one secure a conviction?
- Find a judge who won't need any pressure.

133
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,253
A word with the Lord Chancellor. Find a judge
who's hoping to be made a Lord of Appeal.

134
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,299
Then leave justice to take
her own impartial and majestic course.

135
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,655
- That does the trick?
- Not always.

136
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,611
Sometimes they're so obviously trying to convict,
the jury acquits out of sheer bloody-mindedness.

137
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,329
- You need a judge with common sense.
- Oh, yes.

138
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,298
Won't be as easy as you make out.

139
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,573
- What are you asking me to tell my readers?
- I'm not asking you to tell them anything.

140
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,449
- I'm just putting my side of the story.
- Why the big fuss?

141
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,772
I have not got two faces
and I did not try to suppress that chapter.

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,534
- Can I quote you?
- You may not quote me

143
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,055
denying that I have two faces.

144
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,455
It was worth a try.
Dunno why you're so upset, Jim.

145
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,331
The article doesn't exactly flatter you, but it's
part of the rough and tumble of political life.

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,539
A responsible newspaper ought not
to print such smears. Why did you?

147
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,739
'Cause it sold us over 100,000 extra copies.

148
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,972
Didn't you realise
how damaging that accusation is?

149
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,930
Here's this damaging accusation.
Are you saying you didn't try to stop it?

150
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,173
Of course I didn't. It's a free country.
Freedom of speech.

151
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,969
- It's damaging to you personally.
- Not that damaging.

152
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,736
- What's the fuss, then?
- It's not the damage to me personally I mind.

153
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,690
- It's the damage to Britain that I worry about.
- Britain?

154
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,730
Undermining the leadership can damage
the nation - with foreigners, the pound.

155
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,376
- I want you to retract that suppression story.
- Hm. I don't see how I can.

156
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,250
- Of course you can. You're the editor.
- I'm not a general commanding an army.

157
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,813
I'm the ringmaster of a circus. I book the acts,
but I can't tell the acrobats which way to jump!

158
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,610
It wouldn't be helpful
to make us think we couldn't trust you.

159
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,377
We'd like to cooperate with the press,
but you're making it difficult for us.

160
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,729
I don't think it'd be helpful if you made it seem
as though you were hostile to our paper.

161
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,336
We like to cooperate with No.10,
but if it's war...

162
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,493
No, no, no, no, no, I... No, I wasn't suggesting...

163
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,415
All I meant was that there could be exclusive
interviews, photo opportunities...

164
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,458
- If I retract?
- If you print the truth.

165
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,693
I have to stick by my story
until I get hard evidence that it's not true.

166
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,772
- Such as?
- The minutes of the meeting.

167
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,848
- I don't see why not. My integrity is at stake.
- Prime Minister...

168
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,059
Bernard, the minutes bear out my version
of the meeting, don't they?

169
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,893
Well, I... er... um...

170
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,336
Well, I... er... yes.

171
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,449
Yes, Derek, you may see them. I know they're
usually confidential, but this is a special case.

172
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,932
- Can I publish them?
- We'll see. I'll have another look at them.

173
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,092
Bernard, show them to me this afternoon.

174
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,418
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Yes?

175
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,368
- Sir Humphrey, have you got a moment?
- Yes, Bernard.

176
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,614
Er... I've got a problem.

177
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,975
- Yes, Bernard.
- You know?

178
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,732
- Yes.
- How?

179
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,212
- Because you've just told me.
- Do you know what my problem is?

180
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,656
Your problem is
that you don't ever come to the point.

181
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,336
Sorry. The PM has just had lunch
with Derek Burnham, the editor...

182
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,298
- I know who he is.
- The PM told him

183
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,250
that the minutes of Cabinet Committee confirm
that he didn't try to suppress chapter 8

184
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,014
and that he'd publish them if necessary.

185
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,378
- So what is your problem?
- Well, the minutes aren't written yet.

186
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,816
- I see.
- So, er, what should I do?

187
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,776
Write them, dear Bernard.

188
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,728
The problem is the PM did try to suppress
the chapter, didn't he?

189
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,532
- I don't know. Did he?
- Don't you remember?

190
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,410
What I remember is irrelevant. If the minutes
don't say that he did, then he didn't.

191
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,810
- So you want me to falsify the minutes?
- I want nothing of the sort!

192
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,371
- What do YOU want, Bernard?
- I want to have a clear conscience.

193
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,531
- A clear conscience.
- Yes.

194
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,374
When did you acquire this taste for luxuries?

195
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,852
Consciences are for politicians, Bernard.

196
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,011
We are humble functionaries

197
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,173
whose duty it is to implement the commands
of elected representatives.

198
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,460
How could we be doing anything wrong if it has
been commanded by those representatives?

199
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,408
- I can't accept that. No man is an island.
- I agree, Bernard.

200
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,572
"No man is an island, entire of itself;

201
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,935
"And therefore

202
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,128
"never send to know for whom the bell tolls."

203
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,768
It tolls for thee, Bernard.

204
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,771
- So what do you suggest, Sir Humphrey?
- Minutes do not record everything, do they?

205
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,933
- No, of course not.
- People change their minds during a meeting.

206
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,378
- Yes...
- So the meeting is a mass of ingredients.

207
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,738
- Oh, like cooking.
- Like... No, not like cooking, Bernard.

208
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,893
Better not use that word
in connection with books or minutes.

209
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,451
You choose from a jumble of ill-digested ideas

210
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,612
a version which represents the PM's views

211
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,614
as he would, on reflection,
have liked them to emerge.

212
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,010
But if it's not a true record...

213
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,174
The purpose of minutes is not to record events,
it is to protect people.

214
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,334
You do not take notes if the Prime Minister
says something he did not mean to say,

215
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,290
particularly if it contradicts something
he has said publicly.

216
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,488
You try to improve on what has been said,
put it in a better order. You are tactful.

217
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,050
- But how do I justify that?
- You are his servant.

218
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,611
- Oh, yes.
- A minute is a note for the records

219
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,568
and a statement of action, if any,
that was agreed upon.

220
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,733
- What happened at the meeting?
- Well, the book was discussed.

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,371
The Solicitor General advised there were
no legal grounds for suppressing it.

222
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,328
And did the PM accept
what the Solicitor General had said?

223
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,288
He accepted the fact
there were no legal grounds for suppression...

224
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,655
He accepted the fact

225
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,769
that there were no legal grounds
for suppression. You see?

226
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,737
Oh.

227
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,215
- Is that a lie?
- No.

228
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,575
- Can you write it in the minutes?
- Yes.

229
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,130
- How's your conscience?
- Much better, thank you.

230
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,972
Bernard Woolley?
Your minutes were published today.

231
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,179
- The minutes of Jim Hacker's meeting.
- I know. I've got to go to work.

232
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,934
- Answer a few questions.
- I can't comment.

233
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,978
- But it all looks very suspicious.
- What?

234
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,531
- Why did it take so long to publish them?
- Because they weren't...

235
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,089
Weren't cleared for publication?

236
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,335
- But the PM cleared them last Thursday.
- Yes, but there's the Official Secrets Act.

237
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,096
- So how can they be cleared for publication?
- The PM can clear anything.

238
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,253
Are you saying the PM
is not subject to the Official Secrets Act?

239
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,174
- Well... no.
- No, he is or no, he isn't?

240
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,492
- Yes.
- You're saying that Hacker makes the rules.

241
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,616
- No.
- That's what you said.

242
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,217
- Yes.
- So the Prime Minister is above the law.

243
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,894
- Not in theory.
- But in practice?

244
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,615
- No comment.
- Very interesting.

245
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,737
Look, I'm not sure I've made myself clear.

246
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,130
Oh, you've made it very clear.

247
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,088
Any truth in the rumour
that your minutes took four days to appear

248
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,377
because Mr Hacker
can only type with two fingers?

249
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,691
Excuse me, I must go.

250
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,889
Oh... er... by the way,
I was speaking off the record.

251
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,449
Sorry, a bit late to say that now.

252
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,100
- Prime Minister.
- Yes, Bernard?

253
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,252
- Have you got a moment?
- Yes, Bernard.

254
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,218
Er... I've got a problem.

255
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,219
- Get on with it, Bernard.
- Er... yes.

256
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,940
I've just been interviewed by the press.

257
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,809
- You? You gave an interview?
- Er, yes, I'm afraid so.

258
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,371
- That's not your job.
- I couldn't help it. I just... It just happened.

259
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,930
- They trapped me into speaking to them.
- What did you say?

260
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,695
- Nothing, really.
- Well, what's your problem?

261
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,058
- They were asking me about you.
- What about me?

262
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,609
- About the Official Secrets Act.
- And?

263
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,499
- Whether you were bound by it.
- Of course I am!

264
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,573
Of course you are,
but it... it might not come out like that.

265
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,491
What do you mean?

266
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,654
Thinking back on what I said and what they said
and what I said you said

267
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,539
and what they may say I said you said

268
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,170
or what they may have thought I said
I thought you thought,

269
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,730
they may say I said I thought you said
you thought...

270
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,088
Go on, Bernard.

271
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,219
Well, I think I said you said you thought
you were above the law.

272
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,570
You said that?!

273
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,178
Not intentionally. It's just the way it came out.
They were asking me all these questions.

274
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,810
What makes you think
you have to answer them?

275
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,609
- I don't know.
- You've never answered my questions!

276
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,772
- I know...
- After a lifetime in the Civil Service,

277
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,932
a career devoted to avoiding questions,

278
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,570
you suddenly decide to answer them today
and to the press?!

279
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,856
You must have flipped your lid!

280
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,413
Please don't shout at me! I assure you,
I won't answer questions ever again!

281
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,929
Get Humphrey and Bill in here.

282
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,052
Send Sir Humphrey in and Bill Pritchard.

283
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,613
If this question should ever arise again,
this is how you deal with questions.

284
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,248
If you have nothing to say, say nothing.

285
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,413
Better still, have something to say and say it,
no matter what they ask.

286
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,289
Pay no attention to the question.
Just make your own statement.

287
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,248
If they ask the question again, you say,
"That's not the question"

288
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,017
or "I think the real question is..." and then
you make another statement of your own.

289
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,858
- How's that leak inquiry coming on?
- The wheels will be turning very soon.

290
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,013
I asked you a week ago!
What's the matter with you two?

291
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,172
I'm sorry, I had no idea you were serious.

292
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,729
Leak inquiries are not usually pursued.

293
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,495
I want this one pursued rigorously
and immediately!

294
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,049
- Rigorously?
- And immediately.

295
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,212
- Immediately?
- Immediately.

296
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,372
You mean you REALLY want it pursued?

297
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,294
Watch the lips move, Humphrey.
I want it pursued. Now.

298
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,850
Very well, Prime Minister, if you're serious.

299
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,332
I will arrange a genuine inquiry
if that's what you really want.

300
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,095
- I'll get Inspector Plod of the Special Branch.
- Thank you.

301
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,256
We must do something to improve my relations
with the press, which deteriorated considerably

302
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,370
when my private secretary told them I felt I was
above the law when it came to official secrets.

303
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,054
Yes, you may well hang your head.

304
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,971
- What's the constitutional position, Humphrey?
- Well, in a sense, Bernard was right.

305
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,337
The question, in a nutshell,
is what is the difference

306
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,537
between a breach of the Official Secrets Act

307
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,012
and an unattributable, off-the-record briefing
by a senior official?

308
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,176
The former - a breach - is a criminal offence.
A briefing is essential to keep the wheels turning.

309
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,333
Is there a difference or is it a matter
of convenience and interpretation?

310
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,813
Is it a breach of the act if there is
an unofficial, non-attributable briefing

311
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,768
by an official who's been unofficially authorised
by the Prime Minister?

312
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,853
- Not if it's been authorised by the PM, no.
- That's what I say.

313
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,811
I should decide if it's in the national interest
for something to be disclosed, not officials.

314
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,771
- Last week's leak must've come from an official.
- But what if the official was officially authorised

315
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,090
or even unofficially authorised?

316
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,256
What if the PM officially disapproves of
a breach of the act, but unofficially approves?

317
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,016
Then a leak would be unofficially official,
but officially unofficial.

318
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,377
- Thank you. You've been a tremendous help.
- Thank you.

319
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,250
Now, we've got to do something to repair
the damage you two have done to me.

320
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,810
I'd better have lunch with another editor,
a friendlier one.

321
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:33,499
- None of them are friendly at the moment.
- Couldn't we offer one of them a knighthood?

322
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,259
That can work for or against you. Do you have
any control over them once you've given it?

323
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,490
Wouldn't they be pleased?

324
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,131
Having got an honour, he may feel free
to say what he likes. Nothing to lose.

325
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,291
You don't get gratitude afterwards.

326
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,578
Gratitude is merely a lively expectation
of favours to come.

327
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,411
May I suggest that instead of trying
to butter up the press, we distract them?

328
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,730
- Let's give them a story.
- Such as?

329
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,209
Start a war, that sort of thing.

330
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,054
- Start a war?!
- Only a small war.

331
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,139
Um... if I might intervene.

332
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,019
Even a small war would be overkill.

333
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,057
Why don't you expel 76 Soviet diplomats?

334
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,898
That's always been our practice when we wish
to ensure the press lose interest in something.

335
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,255
- I can't do that.
- Great headline.

336
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,412
"Government cracks down on red spy ring."
Very patriotic.

337
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,371
- It must be a story that nobody can disprove.
- And which will be believed even if it's denied.

338
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,091
"Soviet ambassador's chauffeur
is Lieutenant General in KGB."

339
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,330
I can't do that.
I've been working at this detente for weeks.

340
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,492
It's the only thing that IS working at the moment.

341
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,051
What do you think, Bernard? You're good
at getting things into the papers.

342
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,654
- What about a royal event?
- Such as?

343
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,654
An engagement, a divorce, a pregnancy.

344
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,249
You can arrange that?

345
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,289
- Has he read the leak inquiry report?
- Yes. How do we handle it?

346
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,376
Very difficult. There is almost no precedent for
handling a leak inquiry which finds the culprit.

347
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,897
- Especially when it's a senior civil servant.
- I think we can save him.

348
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,450
How? He was at the meeting. He's owned up.

349
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,818
- There can't be any doubt that he is the leaker.
- There's going to be.

350
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,130
(INTERCOM BUZZER)

351
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,579
There, Humphrey, you see? Just as I suspected.

352
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,938
I want that press officer
at the Department of Energy prosecuted.

353
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,775
- I think not...
- You think not? Because he's a civil servant?

354
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,852
No, because it is not in your interests.

355
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,059
That somebody should be punished
for undermining government?

356
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,211
The Attorney General

357
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,374
says that a prosecution would not succeed
because there are no security implications.

358
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,895
At least it'd make an example of him.

359
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,259
He advises that if we prosecute, we must
undertake a similar Special Branch inquiry

360
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,254
into the earlier leak of chapter 5 -
your success in Kumran.

361
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,617
Ah... well... that was completely different.

362
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,817
- May one ask why?
- Well, it was harmless.

363
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,132
The Attorney General says that
either both leaks are harmless or neither.

364
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,736
Shall I ask Special Branch
to work on the chapter 5 leak?

365
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,097
Drop the prosecution, but sack the press officer.

366
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,414
That could be difficult. There is evidence
he was not acting on his own initiative.

367
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,572
- Meaning?
- They were his Secretary of State's wishes.

368
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,335
- What?!
- The Secretary was not displeased

369
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,618
at being described as the ablest minister
and he told his press officer

370
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,571
that far from wanting the chapter suppressed,
he wouldn't mind seeing it in the press at once.

371
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,528
With reference to the fact
that it might not otherwise be read

372
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,534
- because of an attempt by No.10 to censor it.
- You sure of this?

373
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,693
I am sure that's what
the press officer's explanation will be

374
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,331
when his case for wrongful dismissal comes up
before the industrial tribunal.

375
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,891
- Wrongful dismissal?
- He'll argue he was following an implied order.

376
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,531
- Carrying out his Secretary of State's wishes.
- So I can't sack him.

377
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,171
- Well, who can I sack?
- Well, if you must sack somebody,

378
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,970
the only candidate is the Energy Secretary
who is responsible for his department.

379
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,691
I can't do that. I lost one minister last week.
I can't sack another this week.

380
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,253
Quite, Prime Minister. To lose one Cabinet
minister may be regarded as a misfortune.

381
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,412
To lose both looks like carelessness.

382
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,658
Thank you, Bernard. Furthermore, Prime Minister,

383
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:03,134
as the Energy Secretary did not do the leaking,
he might sue for wrongful dismissal as well.

384
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,656
The press is clamouring
for the result of this inquiry.

385
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,893
Well, the press office...
has drafted this statement.

386
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,898
"Communications breakdown...
misunderstanding...

387
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,656
"...acted in good faith...
will be dealt with by internal procedures."

388
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,371
- This is a whitewash.
- Not really. It shares out the blame equally.

389
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,929
More of a grey wash.

390
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,013
Still looks like I tried to suppress that chapter.
What am I to do?

391
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,810
Perhaps we should send the story out,
but smother it.

392
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,778
Smother it? You mean...

393
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,979
Oh, Prime Minister,
I've been meaning to tell you.

394
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,134
There's some very worrying information
on the Foreign Office files about espionage

395
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,849
in the Soviet embassy and trade delegation.

396
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,377
- No?
- Evidence against a lot of diplomats.

397
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,011
How many?

398
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,171
(BOTH) 76.

399
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,130
You know, I think the time has come to be firm.

400
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,690
- Absolutely.
- The defence of the realm is at stake.

401
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,854
- Precisely.
- Expel them. And I want the press told today.

402
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,488
(BOTH) At the same time...

403
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,651
Yes, Prime Minister.
